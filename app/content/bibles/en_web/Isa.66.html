<span class="verse Isa_66_1" data-osis="Isa.66.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of house will you build to me? and what place shall be my rest?</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_2" data-osis="Isa.66.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For all these things has my hand made, and so all these things came to be,&rdquo; says Yahweh:<br /> &ldquo;but to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_3" data-osis="Isa.66.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog&rsquo;s neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig&rsquo;s blood; he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_4" data-osis="Isa.66.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they didn&rsquo;t listen; but they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn&rsquo;t delight.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_66_5" data-osis="Isa.66.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word: &ldquo;Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name&rsquo;s sake, have said,<br /> &lsquo;Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy;&rsquo; but it is those who shall be disappointed.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_6" data-osis="Isa.66.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_66_7" data-osis="Isa.66.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Before she travailed, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a son.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_8" data-osis="Isa.66.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she gave birth to her children.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_9" data-osis="Isa.66.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?&rdquo; says Yahweh: &ldquo;shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?&rdquo; says your God.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_10" data-osis="Isa.66.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_11" data-osis="Isa.66.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_66_12" data-osis="Isa.66.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and you will nurse. You will be carried on her side, and will be dandled on her knees.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_13" data-osis="Isa.66.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_66_14" data-osis="Isa.66.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_15" data-osis="Isa.66.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_16" data-osis="Isa.66.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_66_17" data-osis="Isa.66.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig&rsquo;s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_66_18" data-osis="Isa.66.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For I know their works and their thoughts: the time comes, that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_66_19" data-osis="Isa.66.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off, who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_20" data-osis="Isa.66.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_21" data-osis="Isa.66.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Of them also will I take for priests and for Levites,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>

<span class="verse Isa_66_23" data-osis="Isa.66.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_66_24" data-osis="Isa.66.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;They shall go out, and look on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they will be loathsome to all mankind.&rdquo;</span>
