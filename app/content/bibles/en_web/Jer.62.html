<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh shall name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your land shall be married.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who call on Yahweh, take no rest,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Go through, go through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Cast up, cast up the highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.62.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>They shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh: and you shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</span>
