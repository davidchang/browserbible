<span class="verse Josh_14_1" data-osis="Josh.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>These are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to them,</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_2" data-osis="Josh.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_3" data-osis="Josh.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_4" data-osis="Josh.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their livestock and for their property.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_5" data-osis="Josh.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they divided the land.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_14_6" data-osis="Josh.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &ldquo;You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_7" data-osis="Josh.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him word again as it was in my heart.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_8" data-osis="Josh.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_9" data-osis="Josh.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Moses swore on that day, saying, &lsquo;Surely the land where you walked shall be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly followed Yahweh my God.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_14_10" data-osis="Josh.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_11" data-osis="Josh.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, to go out and to come in.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_12" data-osis="Josh.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_14_13" data-osis="Josh.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_14" data-osis="Josh.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_14_15" data-osis="Josh.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. The land had rest from war.</span>
