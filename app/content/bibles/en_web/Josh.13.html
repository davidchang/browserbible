<span class="verse Josh_13_5" data-osis="Josh.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_13_6" data-osis="Josh.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_13_7" data-osis="Josh.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Josh_13_13" data-osis="Josh.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the children of Israel didn&rsquo;t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.</span>
