<span class="verse Jer_14_1" data-osis="Jer.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_2" data-osis="Jer.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Judah mourns, and its gates languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_3" data-osis="Jer.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_4" data-osis="Jer.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed, they cover their heads.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_5" data-osis="Jer.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes her young, because there is no grass.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_6" data-osis="Jer.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_7" data-osis="Jer.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Though our iniquities testify against us, work for your name&rsquo;s sake, Yahweh; for our rebellions are many; we have sinned against you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_8" data-osis="Jer.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You hope of Israel, its Savior in the time of trouble, why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_9" data-osis="Jer.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can&rsquo;t save? Yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don&rsquo;t leave us.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_10" data-osis="Jer.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_11" data-osis="Jer.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, Don&rsquo;t pray for this people for their good.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_12" data-osis="Jer.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_13" data-osis="Jer.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then I said, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_14" data-osis="Jer.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn&rsquo;t send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_15" data-osis="Jer.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn&rsquo;t send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_16" data-osis="Jer.14.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them&mdash;them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_17" data-osis="Jer.14.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_18" data-osis="Jer.14.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>If I go out into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_19" data-osis="Jer.14.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_20" data-osis="Jer.14.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_21" data-osis="Jer.14.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Do not abhor us, for your name&rsquo;s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don&rsquo;t break your covenant with us.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_14_22" data-osis="Jer.14.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren&rsquo;t you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.</span>
