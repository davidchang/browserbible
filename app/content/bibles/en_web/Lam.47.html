<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers don&rsquo;t look back to their children for feebleness of hands;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet? Put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.47.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>How can you be quiet, since Yahweh has given you a command? Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has he appointed it.</span>
