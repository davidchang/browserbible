<span class="verse Judg_12_3" data-osis="Judg.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When I saw that you didn&rsquo;t save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand.

<span class="verse Judg_12_4" data-osis="Judg.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, &ldquo;You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_12_5" data-osis="Judg.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when the fugitives of Ephraim said, &ldquo;Let me go over,&rdquo; the men of Gilead said to him, &ldquo;Are you an Ephraimite?&rdquo; If he said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_12_6" data-osis="Judg.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>then they said to him, &ldquo;Now say &lsquo;Shibboleth;&rsquo;&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Sibboleth&rdquo;; for he couldn&rsquo;t manage to pronounce it right: then they seized him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.</span>
