</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_28_10" data-osis="1Sam.28.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, no punishment shall happen to you for this thing.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_28_17" data-osis="1Sam.28.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me. Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_28_18" data-osis="1Sam.28.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Because you didn&rsquo;t obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn&rsquo;t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_28_21" data-osis="1Sam.28.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was very troubled, and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_28_23" data-osis="1Sam.28.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But he refused, and said, &ldquo;I will not eat.&rdquo; But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_28_24" data-osis="1Sam.28.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The woman had a fattened calf in the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.</span>
