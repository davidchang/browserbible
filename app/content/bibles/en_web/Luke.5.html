<span class="verse Luke_5_1" data-osis="Luke.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_2" data-osis="Luke.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_3" data-osis="Luke.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_4" data-osis="Luke.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_5" data-osis="Luke.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Simon answered him, &ldquo;Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_6" data-osis="Luke.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_7" data-osis="Luke.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_8" data-osis="Luke.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_9" data-osis="Luke.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_10" data-osis="Luke.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.<br>Jesus said to Simon, \wj “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”\wj*</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_11" data-osis="Luke.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_12" data-osis="Luke.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>It happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_13" data-osis="Luke.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I want to. Be made clean.&rdquo;</span><br>Immediately the leprosy left him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_14" data-osis="Luke.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He commanded him to tell no one, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_15" data-osis="Luke.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_16" data-osis="Luke.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_17" data-osis="Luke.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>It happened on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_18" data-osis="Luke.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_19" data-osis="Luke.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_20" data-osis="Luke.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Seeing their faith, he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_21" data-osis="Luke.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &ldquo;Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_22" data-osis="Luke.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_23" data-osis="Luke.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which is easier to say, &lsquo;Your sins are forgiven you;&rsquo; or to say, &lsquo;Arise and walk?&rsquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_24" data-osis="Luke.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;</span> (he said to the paralyzed man), <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse Luke_5_25" data-osis="Luke.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_26" data-osis="Luke.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, &ldquo;We have seen strange things today.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_27" data-osis="Luke.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>After these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_28" data-osis="Luke.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>He left everything, and rose up and followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_29" data-osis="Luke.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_30" data-osis="Luke.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, &ldquo;Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_31" data-osis="Luke.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_32" data-osis="Luke.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_33" data-osis="Luke.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Why do John&rsquo;s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Luke_5_34" data-osis="Luke.5.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_5_35" data-osis="Luke.5.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.&rdquo;</span></span>
