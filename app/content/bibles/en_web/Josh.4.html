<span class="verse Josh_4_3" data-osis="Josh.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and command them, saying, &lsquo;Take from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests&rsquo; feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_4_4" data-osis="Josh.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</span>

<span class="verse Josh_4_6" data-osis="Josh.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying, &lsquo;What do you mean by these stones?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_4_7" data-osis="Josh.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>then you shall tell them, &lsquo;Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Josh_4_10" data-osis="Josh.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_4_11" data-osis="Josh.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>It happened, when all the people had completely passed over, that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests, in the presence of the people.</span>

<span class="verse Josh_4_19" data-osis="Josh.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.</span>
