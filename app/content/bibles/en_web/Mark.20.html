<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ A denarius is a silver Roman coin worth 1/25th of a Roman aureus. This was a common wage for a day of farm labor.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He went out about the third hour,</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ Time was measured from sunrise to sunset, so the third hour would be about 9:00 AM.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> To them he said, &lsquo;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.&rsquo; So they went their way. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ noon and 3:00 P. M.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> and did likewise. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> About the eleventh hour</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ 5:00 PM</dfn></span><span class="woc"> he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them, &lsquo;Why do you stand here all day idle?&rsquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;They said to him, &lsquo;Because no one has hired us.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, &lsquo;Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> saying, &lsquo;These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!&rsquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But he answered one of them, &lsquo;Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn&rsquo;t you agree with me for a denarius? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Isn&rsquo;t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>He said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ TR reads &ldquo;let him be&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;</dfn></span><span class="woc"> your servant. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>They told him, &ldquo;Lord, that our eyes may be opened.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.20.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him.</span>
