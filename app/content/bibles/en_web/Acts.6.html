<span class="verse Acts_6_2" data-osis="Acts.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, &ldquo;It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_6_3" data-osis="Acts.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Acts_6_5" data-osis="Acts.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_6_6" data-osis="Acts.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_6_7" data-osis="Acts.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span>

<span class="verse Acts_6_10" data-osis="Acts.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They weren&rsquo;t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_6_11" data-osis="Acts.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then they secretly induced men to say, &ldquo;We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.&rdquo;</span>
