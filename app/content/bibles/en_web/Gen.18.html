<span class="verse Gen_18_1" data-osis="Gen.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_2" data-osis="Gen.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_3" data-osis="Gen.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and said, &ldquo;My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don&rsquo;t go away from your servant.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_4" data-osis="Gen.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_5" data-osis="Gen.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant.&rdquo;<br>They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_6" data-osis="Gen.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, &ldquo;Quickly prepare three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_7" data-osis="Gen.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_8" data-osis="Gen.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_9" data-osis="Gen.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &ldquo;Where is Sarah, your wife?&rdquo;<br>He said, “See, in the tent.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_10" data-osis="Gen.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.&rdquo;<br>Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_11" data-osis="Gen.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_12" data-osis="Gen.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Sarah laughed within herself, saying, &ldquo;After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_13" data-osis="Gen.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Abraham, &ldquo;Why did Sarah laugh, saying, &lsquo;Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_14" data-osis="Gen.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_15" data-osis="Gen.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then Sarah denied, saying, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; for she was afraid.<br>He said, “No, but you did laugh.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_16" data-osis="Gen.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_17" data-osis="Gen.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, &ldquo;Will I hide from Abraham what I do,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_18" data-osis="Gen.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_19" data-osis="Gen.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_20" data-osis="Gen.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, &ldquo;Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_21" data-osis="Gen.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_22" data-osis="Gen.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_23" data-osis="Gen.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Abraham drew near, and said, &ldquo;Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_24" data-osis="Gen.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_25" data-osis="Gen.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn&rsquo;t the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_26" data-osis="Gen.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said, &ldquo;If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_27" data-osis="Gen.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Abraham answered, &ldquo;See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_18_28" data-osis="Gen.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_29" data-osis="Gen.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>He spoke to him yet again, and said, &ldquo;What if there are forty found there?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_30" data-osis="Gen.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_31" data-osis="Gen.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_32" data-osis="Gen.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_18_33" data-osis="Gen.18.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.</span>
