<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_1" data-osis="2Kgs.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_2" data-osis="2Kgs.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn&rsquo;t depart from it.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_3" data-osis="2Kgs.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_4" data-osis="2Kgs.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_5" data-osis="2Kgs.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_6" data-osis="2Kgs.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they didn&rsquo;t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_7" data-osis="2Kgs.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For he didn&rsquo;t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_8" data-osis="2Kgs.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren&rsquo;t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_9" data-osis="2Kgs.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his place.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_10" data-osis="2Kgs.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_11" data-osis="2Kgs.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; he didn&rsquo;t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_12" data-osis="2Kgs.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren&rsquo;t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_13" data-osis="2Kgs.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_14" data-osis="2Kgs.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, &ldquo;My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_15" data-osis="2Kgs.13.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Elisha said to him, &ldquo;Take bow and arrows&rdquo;; and he took to him bow and arrows.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_16" data-osis="2Kgs.13.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;Put your hand on the bow&rdquo;; and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his hands on the king&rsquo;s hands.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_17" data-osis="2Kgs.13.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Open the window eastward&rdquo;; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; and he shot. He said, &ldquo;Yahweh&rsquo;s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_18" data-osis="2Kgs.13.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Take the arrows&rdquo;; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;Strike the ground&rdquo;; and he struck three times, and stopped.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_19" data-osis="2Kgs.13.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The man of God was angry with him, and said, &ldquo;You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_20" data-osis="2Kgs.13.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_21" data-osis="2Kgs.13.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It happened, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_22" data-osis="2Kgs.13.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_23" data-osis="2Kgs.13.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_24" data-osis="2Kgs.13.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his place.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_13_25" data-osis="2Kgs.13.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war.
