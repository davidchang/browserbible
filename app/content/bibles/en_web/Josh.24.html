<span class="verse Josh_24_2" data-osis="Josh.24.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to all the people, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &lsquo;Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_3" data-osis="Josh.24.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_4" data-osis="Josh.24.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_5" data-osis="Josh.24.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in its midst: and afterward I brought you out.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_6" data-osis="Josh.24.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen to the Red Sea.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_7" data-osis="Josh.24.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you lived in the wilderness many days.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_8" data-osis="Josh.24.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_9" data-osis="Josh.24.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_10" data-osis="Josh.24.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_11" data-osis="Josh.24.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho.

<span class="verse Josh_24_12" data-osis="Josh.24.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword, nor with your bow.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_13" data-osis="Josh.24.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities which you didn&rsquo;t build, and you live in them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn&rsquo;t plant.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_14" data-osis="Josh.24.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_15" data-osis="Josh.24.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>If it seems evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_16" data-osis="Josh.24.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The people answered, &ldquo;Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_17" data-osis="Josh.24.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>for it is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_18" data-osis="Josh.24.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_19" data-osis="Josh.24.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to the people, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_20" data-osis="Josh.24.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after he has done you good.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_21" data-osis="Josh.24.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The people said to Joshua, &ldquo;No; but we will serve Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_23" data-osis="Josh.24.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_24" data-osis="Josh.24.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The people said to Joshua, &ldquo;We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_25" data-osis="Josh.24.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_26" data-osis="Josh.24.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_27" data-osis="Josh.24.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to all the people, &ldquo;Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you deny your God.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_28" data-osis="Josh.24.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_24_29" data-osis="Josh.24.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred and ten years old.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_30" data-osis="Josh.24.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_31" data-osis="Josh.24.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_32" data-osis="Josh.24.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>They buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. They became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_24_33" data-osis="Josh.24.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Eleazar the son of Aaron died. They buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill country of Ephraim.</span>
