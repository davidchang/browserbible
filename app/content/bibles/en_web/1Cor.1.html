<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_1" data-osis="1Cor.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_2" data-osis="1Cor.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_3" data-osis="1Cor.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_4" data-osis="1Cor.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_5" data-osis="1Cor.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_6" data-osis="1Cor.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_7" data-osis="1Cor.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_8" data-osis="1Cor.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_9" data-osis="1Cor.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_10" data-osis="1Cor.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Now I beg you, brothers,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</span></span>  through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_11" data-osis="1Cor.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe&rsquo;s household, that there are contentions among you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_12" data-osis="1Cor.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now I mean this, that each one of you says, &ldquo;I follow Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;I follow Apollos,&rdquo; &ldquo;I follow Cephas,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;I follow Christ.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_13" data-osis="1Cor.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_14" data-osis="1Cor.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_15" data-osis="1Cor.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_16" data-osis="1Cor.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don&rsquo;t know whether I baptized any other.)</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_17" data-osis="1Cor.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News&mdash;not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn&rsquo;t be made void.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_18" data-osis="1Cor.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_19" data-osis="1Cor.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For it is written,<br /> &ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,<br /> I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 29:14</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_20" data-osis="1Cor.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn&rsquo;t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_21" data-osis="1Cor.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn&rsquo;t know God, it was God&rsquo;s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_22" data-osis="1Cor.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_23" data-osis="1Cor.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_24" data-osis="1Cor.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_25" data-osis="1Cor.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_26" data-osis="1Cor.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_27" data-osis="1Cor.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_28" data-osis="1Cor.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_29" data-osis="1Cor.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>that no flesh should boast before God.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_30" data-osis="1Cor.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>But of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_1_31" data-osis="1Cor.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>that, according as it is written, &ldquo;He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Jeremiah 9:24</span></span> </span>
