<span class="verse Isa_23_8" data-osis="Isa.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_9" data-osis="Isa.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_10" data-osis="Isa.23.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_11" data-osis="Isa.23.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan&rsquo;s strongholds.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_12" data-osis="Isa.23.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Isa_23_13" data-osis="Isa.23.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_14" data-osis="Isa.23.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!</span>

<span class="verse Isa_23_16" data-osis="Isa.23.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_23_17" data-osis="Isa.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.</span>
