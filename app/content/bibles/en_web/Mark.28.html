<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The angel answered the women, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Go quickly and tell his disciples, &lsquo;He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.&rsquo; Behold, I have told you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Go tell my brothers </span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here may be also correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</dfn></span><span class="woc"> that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>If this comes to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.28.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&rdquo;</span> Amen.</span>
