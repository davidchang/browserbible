<span class="verse Ezek_41_1" data-osis="Ezek.41.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tent.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_2" data-osis="Ezek.41.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_3" data-osis="Ezek.41.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_4" data-osis="Ezek.41.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the most holy place.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_5" data-osis="Ezek.41.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on every side.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_6" data-osis="Ezek.41.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_7" data-osis="Ezek.41.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the breadth of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_8" data-osis="Ezek.41.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I saw also that the house had a raised base all around: the foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great cubits.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_9" data-osis="Ezek.41.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side rooms that belonged to the house.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_10" data-osis="Ezek.41.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Between the rooms was a breadth of twenty cubits around the house on every side.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_11" data-osis="Ezek.41.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_12" data-osis="Ezek.41.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_13" data-osis="Ezek.41.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_14" data-osis="Ezek.41.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_15" data-osis="Ezek.41.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_16" data-osis="Ezek.41.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_17" data-osis="Ezek.41.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by measure.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_18" data-osis="Ezek.41.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_19" data-osis="Ezek.41.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side.<ins>thus was it</ins> made through all the house all around:</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_20" data-osis="Ezek.41.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_21" data-osis="Ezek.41.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance <ins>of it</ins> was as the appearance<ins>of the temple</ins>.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_22" data-osis="Ezek.41.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_23" data-osis="Ezek.41.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_24" data-osis="Ezek.41.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The doors had two leaves <ins>apiece</ins>, two turning leaves: two<ins>leaves</ins> for the one door, and two leaves for the other.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_25" data-osis="Ezek.41.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_41_26" data-osis="Ezek.41.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side rooms of the house, and the thresholds.</span>
