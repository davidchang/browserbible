<span class="verse Exod_18_17" data-osis="Exod.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Moses&rsquo; father-in-law said to him, &ldquo;The thing that you do is not good.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_18_18" data-osis="Exod.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_18_19" data-osis="Exod.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_18_20" data-osis="Exod.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_18_21" data-osis="Exod.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_18_22" data-osis="Exod.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Let them judge the people at all times.
