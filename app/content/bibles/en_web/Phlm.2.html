<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God&rsquo;s word may not be blasphemed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>and soundness of speech that can&rsquo;t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</span>
