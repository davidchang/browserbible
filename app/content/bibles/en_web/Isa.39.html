<span class="verse Isa_39_2" data-osis="Isa.39.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn&rsquo;t show them.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_39_3" data-osis="Isa.39.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, &ldquo;What did these men say? Where did they come from to you?&rdquo;<br>Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_39_4" data-osis="Isa.39.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then he asked, &ldquo;What have they seen in your house?&rdquo;<br>Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”</span>

<span class="verse Isa_39_5" data-osis="Isa.39.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, &ldquo;Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_39_6" data-osis="Isa.39.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,&rsquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_39_7" data-osis="Isa.39.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon&rsquo;s palace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
