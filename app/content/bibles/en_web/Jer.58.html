<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Cry aloud, don&rsquo;t spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and didn&rsquo;t forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Why have we fasted,&rsquo; say they, &lsquo;and you don&rsquo;t see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you don&rsquo;t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Isn&rsquo;t it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Then your light shall break out as the morning, and your healing shall spring out speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; Yahweh&rsquo;s glory shall be your rear guard.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Then you shall call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters don&rsquo;t fail.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.58.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>then you shall delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:&rdquo;</span>
