<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_35" data-osis="Mark.1.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_40" data-osis="Mark.1.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, &ldquo;If you want to, you can make me clean.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_41" data-osis="Mark.1.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I want to. Be made clean.&rdquo;</span></span>
