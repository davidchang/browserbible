<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king&rsquo;s harvest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>It happened that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, &ldquo;Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh relented concerning this. &ldquo;It shall not be,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &ldquo;Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh relented concerning this. &ldquo;This also shall not be,&rdquo; says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Amos, what do you see?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For Amos says, &lsquo;Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Amaziah also said to Amos, &ldquo;You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>but don&rsquo;t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king&rsquo;s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Then Amos answered Amaziah, &ldquo;I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet&rsquo;s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, &lsquo;Go, prophesy to my people Israel.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore listen to the word of Yahweh: &lsquo;You say, Don&rsquo;t prophesy against Israel, and don&rsquo;t preach against the house of Isaac.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Obad.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh: &lsquo;Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
