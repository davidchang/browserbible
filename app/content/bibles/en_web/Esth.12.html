<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks, and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with harps.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages around Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>and certain of the priests&rsquo; sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in God&rsquo;s house, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>On that day were men appointed over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>They performed the duty of their God, and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Esth.12.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.</span>
