<span class="verse Hos_5_2" data-osis="Hos.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The rebels are deep in slaughter;<br /> but I discipline all of them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_3" data-osis="Hos.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I know Ephraim,<br /> and Israel is not hidden from me;<br /> for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.<br /> Israel is defiled.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_4" data-osis="Hos.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Their deeds won&rsquo;t allow them to turn to their God;<br /> for the spirit of prostitution is within them,<br /> and they don&rsquo;t know Yahweh.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_5" data-osis="Hos.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The pride of Israel testifies to his face.<br /> Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.<br /> Judah also will stumble with them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_6" data-osis="Hos.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh;<br /> but they won&rsquo;t find him.<br /> He has withdrawn himself from them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_7" data-osis="Hos.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They are unfaithful to Yahweh;<br /> for they have borne illegitimate children.<br /> Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.</span>

<span class="verse Hos_5_13" data-osis="Hos.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;When Ephraim saw his sickness,<br /> and Judah his wound,<br /> Then Ephraim went to Assyria,<br /> and sent to king Jareb:<br /> but he is not able to heal you,<br /> neither will he cure you of your wound.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_5_14" data-osis="Hos.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,<br /> and like a young lion to the house of Judah.<br /> I myself will tear in pieces and go away.<br /> I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.<br /></span>
