<span class="verse Hos_7_1" data-osis="Hos.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When I would heal Israel,<br /> then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,<br /> also the wickedness of Samaria;<br /> for they commit falsehood,<br /> and the thief enters in,<br /> and the gang of robbers ravages outside.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_2" data-osis="Hos.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They don&rsquo;t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.<br /> Now their own deeds have engulfed them.<br /> They are before my face.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_3" data-osis="Hos.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They make the king glad with their wickedness,<br /> and the princes with their lies.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_4" data-osis="Hos.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They are all adulterers.<br /> They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,<br /> from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_5" data-osis="Hos.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.<br /> He joined his hand with mockers.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_6" data-osis="Hos.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For they have prepared their heart like an oven,<br /> while they lie in wait.<br /> Their baker sleeps all the night.<br /> In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_7" data-osis="Hos.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They are all hot as an oven,<br /> and devour their judges.<br /> All their kings have fallen.<br /> There is no one among them who calls to me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_8" data-osis="Hos.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.<br /> Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_9" data-osis="Hos.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Strangers have devoured his strength,<br /> and he doesn&rsquo;t realize it.<br /> Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,<br /> and he doesn&rsquo;t realize it.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_10" data-osis="Hos.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The pride of Israel testifies to his face;<br /> yet they haven&rsquo;t returned to Yahweh their God,<br /> nor sought him, for all this.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_7_11" data-osis="Hos.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.<br /> They call to Egypt.<br /> They go to Assyria.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_12" data-osis="Hos.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When they go, I will spread my net on them.<br /> I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.<br /> I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_13" data-osis="Hos.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Woe to them!<br /> For they have wandered from me.<br /> Destruction to them!<br /> For they have trespassed against me.<br /> Though I would redeem them,<br /> yet they have spoken lies against me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_14" data-osis="Hos.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They haven&rsquo;t cried to me with their heart,<br /> but they howl on their beds.<br /> They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.<br /> They turn away from me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_15" data-osis="Hos.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,<br /> yet they plot evil against me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_7_16" data-osis="Hos.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They return, but not to the Most High.<br /> They are like a faulty bow.<br /> Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.<br /> This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.</span>
