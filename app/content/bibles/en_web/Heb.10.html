<span class="verse Heb_10_1" data-osis="Heb.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_2" data-osis="Heb.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Or else wouldn&rsquo;t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_3" data-osis="Heb.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_4" data-osis="Heb.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_5" data-osis="Heb.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,<br /> &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering you didn&rsquo;t desire,<br /> but you prepared a body for me;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_6" data-osis="Heb.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_7" data-osis="Heb.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)<br /> to do your will, O God.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 40:6-8</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_10_8" data-osis="Heb.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Previously saying, &ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn&rsquo;t desire, neither had pleasure in them&rdquo; (those which are offered according to the law),</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_9" data-osis="Heb.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>then he has said, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to do your will.&rdquo; He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_10" data-osis="Heb.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_11" data-osis="Heb.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_12" data-osis="Heb.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_13" data-osis="Heb.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_14" data-osis="Heb.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_15" data-osis="Heb.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_16" data-osis="Heb.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them:<br /> &lsquo;After those days,&rsquo; says the Lord,<br /> &lsquo;I will put my laws on their heart,<br /> I will also write them on their mind;&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Jeremiah 31:33</span></span> <br>then he says,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_17" data-osis="Heb.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Jeremiah 31:34</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_10_18" data-osis="Heb.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_19" data-osis="Heb.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_20" data-osis="Heb.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_21" data-osis="Heb.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and having a great priest over God&rsquo;s house,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_22" data-osis="Heb.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>let&rsquo;s draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_23" data-osis="Heb.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_10_24" data-osis="Heb.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_25" data-osis="Heb.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as you see the Day approaching.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_26" data-osis="Heb.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_27" data-osis="Heb.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_28" data-osis="Heb.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>A man who disregards Moses&rsquo; law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_29" data-osis="Heb.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_30" data-osis="Heb.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>For we know him who said, &ldquo;Vengeance belongs to me,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;I will repay.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 32:35</span></span>  Again, &ldquo;The Lord will judge his people.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_31" data-osis="Heb.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_32" data-osis="Heb.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_33" data-osis="Heb.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions; and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_34" data-osis="Heb.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_35" data-osis="Heb.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_36" data-osis="Heb.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_37" data-osis="Heb.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;In a very little while,<br /> he who comes will come, and will not wait.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Heb_10_38" data-osis="Heb.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>But the righteous will live by faith.<br /> If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Habakkuk 2:3-4</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_10_39" data-osis="Heb.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.</span>
