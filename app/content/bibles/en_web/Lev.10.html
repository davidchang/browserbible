<span class="verse Lev_10_13" data-osis="Lev.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons&rsquo; portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: for so I am commanded.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_10_14" data-osis="Lev.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons&rsquo; portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_10_15" data-osis="Lev.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh: and it shall be yours, and your sons&rsquo; with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has commanded.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Lev_10_17" data-osis="Lev.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?</span>
<span class="verse Lev_10_18" data-osis="Lev.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.&rdquo;</span>
