<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</span>
