<span class="verse Isa_31_1" data-osis="Isa.31.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,<br /> and rely on horses,<br /> and trust in chariots because they are many,<br /> and in horsemen because they are very strong,<br /> but they don&rsquo;t look to the Holy One of Israel,<br /> and they don&rsquo;t seek Yahweh!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_2" data-osis="Isa.31.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,<br /> and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,<br /> and against the help of those who work iniquity.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_3" data-osis="Isa.31.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;<br /> and their horses flesh, and not spirit.<br /> When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,<br /> and he who is helped shall fall,<br /> and they all shall be consumed together.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_4" data-osis="Isa.31.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh to me,<br /> &ldquo;As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,<br /> if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,<br /> will not be dismayed at their voice,<br /> nor abase himself for their noise,<br /> so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_5" data-osis="Isa.31.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.<br /> He will protect and deliver it.<br /> He will pass over and preserve it.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_6" data-osis="Isa.31.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_7" data-osis="Isa.31.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold&mdash;sin which your own hands have made for you.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_31_8" data-osis="Isa.31.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;<br /> and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.<br /> He will flee from the sword,<br /> and his young men will become subject to forced labor.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_31_9" data-osis="Isa.31.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>His rock will pass away by reason of terror,<br /> and his princes will be afraid of the banner,&rdquo;<br /> says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,<br /> and his furnace in Jerusalem.</span>
