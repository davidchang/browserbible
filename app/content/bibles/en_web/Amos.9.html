<span class="verse Amos_9_4" data-osis="Amos.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span>
<span class="verse Amos_9_5" data-osis="Amos.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.</span>
<span class="verse Amos_9_6" data-osis="Amos.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</span>
<span class="verse Amos_9_7" data-osis="Amos.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?&rdquo; says Yahweh. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>
<span class="verse Amos_9_8" data-osis="Amos.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse Amos_9_11" data-osis="Amos.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</span>
<span class="verse Amos_9_12" data-osis="Amos.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,&rdquo; says Yahweh who does this.<br /></span>
