<span class="verse Jer_11_1" data-osis="Jer.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_2" data-osis="Jer.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_3" data-osis="Jer.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and say to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who doesn&rsquo;t hear the words of this covenant,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_4" data-osis="Jer.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_5" data-osis="Jer.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_6" data-osis="Jer.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_7" data-osis="Jer.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_8" data-osis="Jer.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yet they didn&rsquo;t obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn&rsquo;t do them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_9" data-osis="Jer.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_10" data-osis="Jer.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_11" data-osis="Jer.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_12" data-osis="Jer.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_13" data-osis="Jer.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_14" data-osis="Jer.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_15" data-osis="Jer.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>What has my beloved to do in my house, since she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_16" data-osis="Jer.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Yahweh called your name, A green olive tree, beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and its branches are broken.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_17" data-osis="Jer.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_18" data-osis="Jer.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_19" data-osis="Jer.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I didn&rsquo;t know that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_20" data-osis="Jer.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_21" data-osis="Jer.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, You shall not prophesy in Yahweh&rsquo;s name, that you not die by our hand;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_22" data-osis="Jer.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_11_23" data-osis="Jer.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</span>
