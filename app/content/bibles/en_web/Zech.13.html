<span class="verse Zech_13_3" data-osis="Zech.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, &lsquo;You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh&rsquo;s name;&rsquo; and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_13_4" data-osis="Zech.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</span>
<span class="verse Zech_13_5" data-osis="Zech.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>but he will say, &lsquo;I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Zech_13_6" data-osis="Zech.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>One will say to him, &lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo; Then he will answer, &lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.&rsquo;</span>
