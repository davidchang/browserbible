<span class="verse Dan_7_1" data-osis="Dan.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_2" data-osis="Dan.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the sky broke out on the great sea.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_3" data-osis="Dan.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_4" data-osis="Dan.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The first was like a lion, and had eagle&rsquo;s wings: I saw until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a man; and a man&rsquo;s heart was given to it.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_5" data-osis="Dan.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_6" data-osis="Dan.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the animal had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_7" data-osis="Dan.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_8" data-osis="Dan.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_9" data-osis="Dan.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, <ins>and</ins> its wheels burning fire.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_10" data-osis="Dan.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>A fiery stream issued and came out from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_11" data-osis="Dan.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I saw even until the animal was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_12" data-osis="Dan.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_13" data-osis="Dan.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_14" data-osis="Dan.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_15" data-osis="Dan.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_16" data-osis="Dan.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_17" data-osis="Dan.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_18" data-osis="Dan.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_19" data-osis="Dan.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_20" data-osis="Dan.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other<ins>horn</ins> which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_21" data-osis="Dan.7.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_22" data-osis="Dan.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_23" data-osis="Dan.7.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_24" data-osis="Dan.7.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_25" data-osis="Dan.7.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_26" data-osis="Dan.7.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_27" data-osis="Dan.7.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_7_28" data-osis="Dan.7.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</span>
