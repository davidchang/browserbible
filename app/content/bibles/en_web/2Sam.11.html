<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_1" data-osis="2Sam.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_2" data-osis="2Sam.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king&rsquo;s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_3" data-osis="2Sam.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_4" data-osis="2Sam.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_5" data-osis="2Sam.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, &ldquo;I am with child.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_6" data-osis="2Sam.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>David sent to Joab, &ldquo;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&rdquo; Joab sent Uriah to David.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_7" data-osis="2Sam.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_8" data-osis="2Sam.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Go down to your house, and wash your feet.&rdquo; Uriah departed out of the king&rsquo;s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_9" data-osis="2Sam.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&rsquo;s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn&rsquo;t go down to his house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_10" data-osis="2Sam.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When they had told David, saying, &ldquo;Uriah didn&rsquo;t go down to his house,&rdquo; David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you come from a journey? Why didn&rsquo;t you go down to your house?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_11" data-osis="2Sam.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Uriah said to David, &ldquo;The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_12" data-osis="2Sam.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&rdquo; So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_13" data-osis="2Sam.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn&rsquo;t go down to his house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_14" data-osis="2Sam.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_15" data-osis="2Sam.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He wrote in the letter, saying, &ldquo;Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_16" data-osis="2Sam.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_17" data-osis="2Sam.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_18" data-osis="2Sam.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_19" data-osis="2Sam.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and he commanded the messenger, saying, &ldquo;When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_20" data-osis="2Sam.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>it shall be that, if the king&rsquo;s wrath arise, and he asks you, &lsquo;Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn&rsquo;t you know that they would shoot from the wall?</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_21" data-osis="2Sam.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn&rsquo;t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&rsquo; then you shall say, &lsquo;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_22" data-osis="2Sam.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_23" data-osis="2Sam.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The messenger said to David, &ldquo;The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_24" data-osis="2Sam.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king&rsquo;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_25" data-osis="2Sam.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Then David said to the messenger, &ldquo;Thus you shall tell Joab, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.&rsquo; Encourage him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_26" data-osis="2Sam.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_11_27" data-osis="2Sam.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.</span>
