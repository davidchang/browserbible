<span class="verse 1Chr_15_14" data-osis="1Chr.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse 1Chr_15_25" data-osis="1Chr.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.</span>
