<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For when they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety,&rdquo; then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers, aren&rsquo;t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don&rsquo;t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>so then let&rsquo;s not sleep, as the rest do, but let&rsquo;s watch and be sober.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For God didn&rsquo;t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and to respect and honor them in love for their work&rsquo;s sake.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Rejoice always.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Pray without ceasing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t quench the Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t despise prophesies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Abstain from every form of evil.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Brothers, pray for us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.5.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</span>
