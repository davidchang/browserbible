<p>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_3" data-osis="2Tim.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_4" data-osis="2Tim.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_5" data-osis="2Tim.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_6" data-osis="2Tim.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_7" data-osis="2Tim.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For God didn&rsquo;t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_8" data-osis="2Tim.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_9" data-osis="2Tim.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_10" data-osis="2Tim.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_11" data-osis="2Tim.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_12" data-osis="2Tim.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For this cause I also suffer these things.<br>Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_13" data-osis="2Tim.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_14" data-osis="2Tim.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_15" data-osis="2Tim.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_16" data-osis="2Tim.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_17" data-osis="2Tim.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_18" data-osis="2Tim.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</span>
