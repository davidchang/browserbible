<span class="verse Gen_38_2" data-osis="Gen.38.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_38_5" data-osis="Gen.38.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_6" data-osis="Gen.38.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_7" data-osis="Gen.38.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Er, Judah&rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_8" data-osis="Gen.38.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Judah said to Onan, &ldquo;Go in to your brother&rsquo;s wife, and perform the duty of a husband&rsquo;s brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_9" data-osis="Gen.38.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Onan knew that the seed wouldn&rsquo;t be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother&rsquo;s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_10" data-osis="Gen.38.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_38_12" data-osis="Gen.38.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>After many days, Shua&rsquo;s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_13" data-osis="Gen.38.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It was told Tamar, saying, &ldquo;Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_38_15" data-osis="Gen.38.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_38_17" data-osis="Gen.38.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;I will send you a young goat from the flock.&rdquo;<br>She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_38_22" data-osis="Gen.38.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He returned to Judah, and said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found her; and also the men of the place said, &lsquo;There has been no prostitute here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_38_25" data-osis="Gen.38.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, &ldquo;By the man, whose these are, I am with child.&rdquo; She also said, &ldquo;Please discern whose are these&mdash;the signet, and the cords, and the staff.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_38_26" data-osis="Gen.38.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Judah acknowledged them, and said, &ldquo;She is more righteous than I, because I didn&rsquo;t give her to Shelah, my son.&rdquo;<br>He knew her again no more.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_38_27" data-osis="Gen.38.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>It happened in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.</span>
