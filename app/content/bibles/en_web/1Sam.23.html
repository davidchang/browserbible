<span class="verse 1Sam_23_7" data-osis="1Sam.23.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, &ldquo;God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_8" data-osis="1Sam.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_23_17" data-osis="1Sam.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_18" data-osis="1Sam.23.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They both made a covenant before Yahweh: and David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_24" data-osis="1Sam.23.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_25" data-osis="1Sam.23.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_26" data-osis="1Sam.23.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_27" data-osis="1Sam.23.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, &ldquo;Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_23_28" data-osis="1Sam.23.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.</span>
