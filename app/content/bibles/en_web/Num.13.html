<span class="verse Num_13_15" data-osis="Num.13.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_16" data-osis="Num.13.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_17" data-osis="Num.13.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, &ldquo;Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_18" data-osis="Num.13.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_19" data-osis="Num.13.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_20" data-osis="Num.13.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.&rdquo; Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_13_21" data-osis="Num.13.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_22" data-osis="Num.13.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_23" data-osis="Num.13.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_24" data-osis="Num.13.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_25" data-osis="Num.13.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_26" data-osis="Num.13.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_27" data-osis="Num.13.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>They told him, and said, &ldquo;We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_28" data-osis="Num.13.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_29" data-osis="Num.13.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_13_30" data-osis="Num.13.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, &ldquo;Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_13_31" data-osis="Num.13.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>But the men who went up with him said, &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_32" data-osis="Num.13.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.</span>
<span class="verse Num_13_33" data-osis="Num.13.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.&rdquo;</span>
