</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_32_5" data-osis="Exod.32.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, &ldquo;Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Exod_32_7" data-osis="Exod.32.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, &ldquo;Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_8" data-osis="Exod.32.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them.

<span class="verse Exod_32_12" data-osis="Exod.32.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, &lsquo;He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?&rsquo; Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</span>

<span class="verse Exod_32_23" data-osis="Exod.32.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>For they said to me, &lsquo;Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don&rsquo;t know what has become of him.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_24" data-osis="Exod.32.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>I said to them, &lsquo;Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:&rsquo; so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Exod_32_25" data-osis="Exod.32.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_26" data-osis="Exod.32.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, &ldquo;Whoever is on Yahweh&rsquo;s side, come to me!&rdquo;<br>All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_27" data-osis="Exod.32.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &lsquo;Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_28" data-osis="Exod.32.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_32_29" data-osis="Exod.32.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Moses said, &ldquo;Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.&rdquo;</span>
