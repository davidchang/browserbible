<span class="verse 2Sam_7_19" data-osis="2Sam.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord Yahweh!</span>

<span class="verse 2Sam_7_22" data-osis="2Sam.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>
<span class="verse 2Sam_7_23" data-osis="2Sam.7.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span>
