<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_1" data-osis="Num.16.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_2" data-osis="Num.16.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_3" data-osis="Num.16.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, &ldquo;You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh&rsquo;s assembly?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_4" data-osis="Num.16.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_5" data-osis="Num.16.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>He said to Korah and to all his company, &ldquo;In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_6" data-osis="Num.16.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company;</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_7" data-osis="Num.16.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_8" data-osis="Num.16.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Korah, &ldquo;Hear now, you sons of Levi!</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_9" data-osis="Num.16.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh&rsquo;s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_10" data-osis="Num.16.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_11" data-osis="Num.16.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you murmur against him?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_12" data-osis="Num.16.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t come up!</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_13" data-osis="Num.16.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_14" data-osis="Num.16.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Moreover you haven&rsquo;t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won&rsquo;t come up.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_15" data-osis="Num.16.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_16" data-osis="Num.16.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Korah, &ldquo;You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_17" data-osis="Num.16.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_18" data-osis="Num.16.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_19" data-osis="Num.16.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting.<br>Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_20" data-osis="Num.16.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_21" data-osis="Num.16.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_22" data-osis="Num.16.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They fell on their faces, and said, &ldquo;God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_23" data-osis="Num.16.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_24" data-osis="Num.16.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak to the congregation, saying, &lsquo;Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_25" data-osis="Num.16.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_26" data-osis="Num.16.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>He spoke to the congregation, saying, &ldquo;Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_27" data-osis="Num.16.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_28" data-osis="Num.16.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Moses said, &ldquo;Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_29" data-osis="Num.16.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn&rsquo;t sent me.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_30" data-osis="Num.16.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></span> ; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_31" data-osis="Num.16.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_32" data-osis="Num.16.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, with their households, and all of Korah&rsquo;s men, and all their goods.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_33" data-osis="Num.16.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. <span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></span>  The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_34" data-osis="Num.16.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, &ldquo;Lest the earth swallow us up!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_35" data-osis="Num.16.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_36" data-osis="Num.16.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_37" data-osis="Num.16.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_38" data-osis="Num.16.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>even the censers of these sinners against their own lives. Let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_39" data-osis="Num.16.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_40" data-osis="Num.16.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn&rsquo;t of the seed of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he not be as Korah, and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_41" data-osis="Num.16.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, &ldquo;You have killed Yahweh&rsquo;s people!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_42" data-osis="Num.16.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh&rsquo;s glory appeared.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_43" data-osis="Num.16.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_44" data-osis="Num.16.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_45" data-osis="Num.16.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!&rdquo; They fell on their faces.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_46" data-osis="Num.16.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_16_47" data-osis="Num.16.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. Behold, the plague has begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_48" data-osis="Num.16.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_49" data-osis="Num.16.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.</span>
<span class="verse Num_16_50" data-osis="Num.16.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.</span>
