<span class="verse Rom_3_1" data-osis="Rom.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_2" data-osis="Rom.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_3" data-osis="Rom.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_4" data-osis="Rom.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written,<br /> &ldquo;That you might be justified in your words,<br /> and might prevail when you come into judgment.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 51:4</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_3_5" data-osis="Rom.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_6" data-osis="Rom.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_7" data-osis="Rom.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_8" data-osis="Rom.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), &ldquo;Let us do evil, that good may come?&rdquo; Those who say so are justly condemned.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_9" data-osis="Rom.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_10" data-osis="Rom.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>As it is written,<br /> &ldquo;There is no one righteous;<br /> no, not one.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_11" data-osis="Rom.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>There is no one who understands.<br /> There is no one who seeks after God.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_12" data-osis="Rom.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They have all turned aside.<br /> They have together become unprofitable.<br /> There is no one who does good,<br /> no, not so much as one.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Ecclesiastes 7:20</span></span> <br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_13" data-osis="Rom.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Their throat is an open tomb.<br /> With their tongues they have used deceit.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 5:9</span></span> <br /> &ldquo;The poison of vipers is under their lips&rdquo;;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 140:3</span></span> <br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_14" data-osis="Rom.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 10:7</span></span> <br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_15" data-osis="Rom.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Their feet are swift to shed blood.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_16" data-osis="Rom.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Destruction and misery are in their ways.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_17" data-osis="Rom.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The way of peace, they haven&rsquo;t known.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 59:7-8</span></span> <br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_18" data-osis="Rom.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 36:1</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_3_19" data-osis="Rom.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_20" data-osis="Rom.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_21" data-osis="Rom.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_22" data-osis="Rom.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_23" data-osis="Rom.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_24" data-osis="Rom.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_25" data-osis="Rom.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, a propitiation</span></span> , through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God&rsquo;s forbearance;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_26" data-osis="Rom.3.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_3_27" data-osis="Rom.3.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_28" data-osis="Rom.3.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_29" data-osis="Rom.3.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn&rsquo;t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_30" data-osis="Rom.3.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_3_31" data-osis="Rom.3.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.</span>
