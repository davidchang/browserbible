<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_1" data-osis="2Kgs.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Elisha said, &ldquo;Hear the word of Yahweh. Thus says Yahweh, &lsquo;Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_2" data-osis="2Kgs.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, &ldquo;Behold, if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?&rdquo;<br>He said, “Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_3" data-osis="2Kgs.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, &ldquo;Why do we sit here until we die?</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_4" data-osis="2Kgs.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>If we say, &lsquo;We will enter into the city,&rsquo; then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they kill us, we will only die.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_5" data-osis="2Kgs.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_6" data-osis="2Kgs.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For the Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</span></span>  had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_7" data-osis="2Kgs.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_8" data-osis="2Kgs.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it. Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_9" data-osis="2Kgs.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then they said one to another, &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_10" data-osis="2Kgs.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, &ldquo;We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_11" data-osis="2Kgs.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He called the porters; and they told it to the king&rsquo;s household within.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_12" data-osis="2Kgs.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The king arose in the night, and said to his servants, &ldquo;I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, &lsquo;When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_13" data-osis="2Kgs.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>One of his servants answered, &ldquo;Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who are consumed. Let us send and see.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_14" data-osis="2Kgs.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_15" data-osis="2Kgs.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>They went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the king.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_16" data-osis="2Kgs.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_17" data-osis="2Kgs.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_18" data-osis="2Kgs.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>It happened, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, &ldquo;Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria&rdquo;;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_19" data-osis="2Kgs.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and that captain answered the man of God, and said, &ldquo;Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_7_20" data-osis="2Kgs.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>It happened like that to him; for the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.</span>
