<span class="verse Gen_2_5" data-osis="Gen.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_2_6" data-osis="Gen.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_2_12" data-osis="Gen.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, aromatic resin</span></span>  and onyx stone are also there.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_2_13" data-osis="Gen.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_2_17" data-osis="Gen.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_2_18" data-osis="Gen.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_2_19" data-osis="Gen.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_2_20" data-osis="Gen.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him.</span>
