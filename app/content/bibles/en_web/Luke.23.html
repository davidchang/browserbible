<span class="verse Luke_23_2" data-osis="Luke.23.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>They began to accuse him, saying, &ldquo;We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_3" data-osis="Luke.23.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;<br>He answered him, \wj “So you say.”\wj*</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_4" data-osis="Luke.23.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, &ldquo;I find no basis for a charge against this man.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_5" data-osis="Luke.23.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But they insisted, saying, &ldquo;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_6" data-osis="Luke.23.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_7" data-osis="Luke.23.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When he found out that he was in Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_8" data-osis="Luke.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_9" data-osis="Luke.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_10" data-osis="Luke.23.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_11" data-osis="Luke.23.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_12" data-osis="Luke.23.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</span>

<span class="verse Luke_23_13" data-osis="Luke.23.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_14" data-osis="Luke.23.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, &ldquo;You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_15" data-osis="Luke.23.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_16" data-osis="Luke.23.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_17" data-osis="Luke.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_18" data-osis="Luke.23.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But they all cried out together, saying, &ldquo;Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!&rdquo;&mdash;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_20" data-osis="Luke.23.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_21" data-osis="Luke.23.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>but they shouted, saying, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify him!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Luke_23_22" data-osis="Luke.23.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He said to them the third time, &ldquo;Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_23" data-osis="Luke.23.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_24" data-osis="Luke.23.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_23_25" data-osis="Luke.23.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</span>

<span class="verse Luke_23_35" data-osis="Luke.23.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!&rdquo;</span>
