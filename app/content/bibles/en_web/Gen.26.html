<span class="verse Gen_26_2" data-osis="Gen.26.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh appeared to him, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_3" data-osis="Gen.26.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_4" data-osis="Gen.26.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_5" data-osis="Gen.26.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&rdquo;</span>

He said, &ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; for he was afraid to say, &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; lest, he thought, &ldquo;the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_8" data-osis="Gen.26.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_9" data-osis="Gen.26.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Abimelech called Isaac, and said, &ldquo;Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, &lsquo;She is my sister?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_10" data-osis="Gen.26.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Abimelech said, &ldquo;What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_26_11" data-osis="Gen.26.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, &ldquo;He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_26_18" data-osis="Gen.26.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father.

<span class="verse Gen_26_21" data-osis="Gen.26.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_22" data-osis="Gen.26.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>He left that place, and dug another well. They didn&rsquo;t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth.

<span class="verse Gen_26_26" data-osis="Gen.26.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_26_27" data-osis="Gen.26.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Isaac said to them, &ldquo;Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?&rdquo;</span>
