<span class="verse Matt_22_5" data-osis="Matt.22.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_6" data-osis="Matt.22.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_7" data-osis="Matt.22.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_22_29" data-osis="Matt.22.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_30" data-osis="Matt.22.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God&rsquo;s angels in heaven. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_31" data-osis="Matt.22.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven&rsquo;t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_22_41" data-osis="Matt.22.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_22_42" data-osis="Matt.22.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?&rdquo; </span><br>They said to him, “Of David.”</span>
