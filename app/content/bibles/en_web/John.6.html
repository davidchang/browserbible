<span class="verse John_6_1" data-osis="John.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_2" data-osis="John.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_3" data-osis="John.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus went up into the mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_4" data-osis="John.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_5" data-osis="John.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_6_6" data-osis="John.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_7" data-osis="John.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Philip answered him, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_8" data-osis="John.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to him,</span>
<span class="verse John_6_9" data-osis="John.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_10" data-osis="John.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have the people sit down.&rdquo;</span> Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_11" data-osis="John.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_12" data-osis="John.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When they were filled, he said to his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_6_13" data-osis="John.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_14" data-osis="John.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, &ldquo;This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_6_15" data-osis="John.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_16" data-osis="John.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</span>
<span class="verse John_6_17" data-osis="John.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_18" data-osis="John.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_19" data-osis="John.6.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, <span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">25 to 30 stadia is about 5 to 6 kilometers or about 3 to 4 miles</span></span>  they saw Jesus walking on the sea,<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">see Job 9:8</span></span>  and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_20" data-osis="John.6.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is I.</span><span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, I AM</span></span>  <span class="woc"> Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_6_21" data-osis="John.6.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_22" data-osis="John.6.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn&rsquo;t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_23" data-osis="John.6.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_24" data-osis="John.6.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn&rsquo;t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_6_25" data-osis="John.6.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did you come here?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_26" data-osis="John.6.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_6_27" data-osis="John.6.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Don&rsquo;t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_28" data-osis="John.6.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, &ldquo;What must we do, that we may work the works of God?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_6_29" data-osis="John.6.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_30" data-osis="John.6.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, &ldquo;What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?</span>
<span class="verse John_6_31" data-osis="John.6.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.

<span class="verse John_6_33" data-osis="John.6.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse John_6_38" data-osis="John.6.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_6_39" data-osis="John.6.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up at the last day. </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_41" data-osis="John.6.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am the bread which came down out of heaven.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_60" data-osis="John.6.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, &ldquo;This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_61" data-osis="John.6.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Does this cause you to stumble? </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_6_66" data-osis="John.6.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</span>
