<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_1" data-osis="2Kgs.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, &ldquo;Put your belt on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_2" data-osis="2Kgs.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>When you come there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_3" data-osis="2Kgs.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;I have anointed you king over Israel.&rdquo;&rsquo; Then open the door, flee, and don&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_4" data-osis="2Kgs.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_5" data-osis="2Kgs.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting. Then he said, &ldquo;I have a message for you, captain.&rdquo;<br>Jehu said, “To which of us all?”<br>He said, “To you, O captain.”</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_6" data-osis="2Kgs.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He arose, and went into the house. Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &lsquo;I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_7" data-osis="2Kgs.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_8" data-osis="2Kgs.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, male</span></span>  both him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_9" data-osis="2Kgs.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_10" data-osis="2Kgs.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The dogs will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her.&rsquo;&rdquo; He opened the door, and fled.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_11" data-osis="2Kgs.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then Jehu came out to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, &ldquo;Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?&rdquo;<br>He said to them, “You know the man and what his talk was.”</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_12" data-osis="2Kgs.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;That is a lie. Tell us now.&rdquo;<br>He said, “He said to me, ‘Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you king over Israel.’”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_13" data-osis="2Kgs.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, &ldquo;Jehu is king.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_14" data-osis="2Kgs.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_15" data-osis="2Kgs.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, &ldquo;If this is your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_16" data-osis="2Kgs.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_17" data-osis="2Kgs.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, &ldquo;I see a company.&rdquo;<br>Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, ‘Is it peace?’”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_18" data-osis="2Kgs.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the king, &lsquo;Is it peace?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”<br>The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_19" data-osis="2Kgs.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the king, &lsquo;Is it peace?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_20" data-osis="2Kgs.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The watchman said, &ldquo;He came to them, and isn&rsquo;t coming back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_21" data-osis="2Kgs.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Joram said, &ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo;<br>They got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_22" data-osis="2Kgs.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, &ldquo;Is it peace, Jehu?&rdquo;<br>He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_23" data-osis="2Kgs.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, &ldquo;There is treason, Ahaziah!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_24" data-osis="2Kgs.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_25" data-osis="2Kgs.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, &ldquo;Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him:</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_26" data-osis="2Kgs.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,&rsquo; says Yahweh; &lsquo;and I will repay you in this plot of ground,&rsquo; says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to the word of Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_27" data-osis="2Kgs.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after him, and said, &ldquo;Strike him also in the chariot!&rdquo; They struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died there.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_28" data-osis="2Kgs.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_29" data-osis="2Kgs.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_30" data-osis="2Kgs.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_31" data-osis="2Kgs.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>As Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, &ldquo;Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_32" data-osis="2Kgs.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>He lifted up his face to the window, and said, &ldquo;Who is on my side? Who?&rdquo;<br>Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_33" data-osis="2Kgs.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Throw her down!&rdquo;<br>So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_34" data-osis="2Kgs.9.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>When he had come in, he ate and drink; and he said, &ldquo;See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_35" data-osis="2Kgs.9.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>They went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_36" data-osis="2Kgs.9.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Therefore they came back, and told him.<br>He said, “This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on the plot of Jezreel,</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_9_37" data-osis="2Kgs.9.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, &ldquo;This is Jezebel.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
