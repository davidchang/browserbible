<span class="verse 2Chr_6_3" data-osis="2Chr.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_4" data-osis="2Chr.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_5" data-osis="2Chr.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_6" data-osis="2Chr.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_7" data-osis="2Chr.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_8" data-osis="2Chr.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh said to David my father, &lsquo;Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_6_9" data-osis="2Chr.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.&rsquo;</span>
