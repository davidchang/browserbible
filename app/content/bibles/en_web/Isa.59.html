<span class="verse Isa_59_1" data-osis="Isa.59.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s hand is not shortened, that it can&rsquo;t save; neither his ear heavy, that it can&rsquo;t hear:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_2" data-osis="Isa.59.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_3" data-osis="Isa.59.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_4" data-osis="Isa.59.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>No one sues in righteousness, and no one pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and give birth to iniquity.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_5" data-osis="Isa.59.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They hatch adders&rsquo; eggs, and weave the spider&rsquo;s web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_6" data-osis="Isa.59.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_7" data-osis="Isa.59.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_8" data-osis="Isa.59.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The way of peace they don&rsquo;t know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_9" data-osis="Isa.59.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_10" data-osis="Isa.59.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_11" data-osis="Isa.59.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>We roar all like bears, and moan bitterly like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_59_12" data-osis="Isa.59.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_13" data-osis="Isa.59.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_14" data-osis="Isa.59.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can&rsquo;t enter.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_15" data-osis="Isa.59.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_16" data-osis="Isa.59.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_17" data-osis="Isa.59.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_18" data-osis="Isa.59.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_59_19" data-osis="Isa.59.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>So shall they fear Yahweh&rsquo;s name from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_59_20" data-osis="Isa.59.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;A Redeemer will come to Zion,<br /> and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_59_21" data-osis="Isa.59.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;As for me, this is my covenant with them,&rdquo; says Yahweh. &ldquo;My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed&rsquo;s seed,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;from henceforth and forever.&rdquo;</span>
