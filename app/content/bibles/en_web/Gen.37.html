<span class="verse Gen_37_2" data-osis="Gen.37.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father&rsquo;s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_3" data-osis="Gen.37.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_4" data-osis="Gen.37.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn&rsquo;t speak peaceably to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_37_5" data-osis="Gen.37.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_6" data-osis="Gen.37.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_7" data-osis="Gen.37.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_37_8" data-osis="Gen.37.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>His brothers said to him, &ldquo;Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?&rdquo; They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_9" data-osis="Gen.37.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, &ldquo;Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_10" data-osis="Gen.37.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, &ldquo;What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_11" data-osis="Gen.37.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_37_12" data-osis="Gen.37.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>His brothers went to feed their father&rsquo;s flock in Shechem.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_13" data-osis="Gen.37.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Israel said to Joseph, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.&rdquo; He said to him, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_37_14" data-osis="Gen.37.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He said to him, &ldquo;Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.&rdquo; So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_15" data-osis="Gen.37.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_37_16" data-osis="Gen.37.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_37_17" data-osis="Gen.37.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The man said, &ldquo;They have left here, for I heard them say, &lsquo;Let us go to Dothan.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_18" data-osis="Gen.37.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_19" data-osis="Gen.37.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>They said one to another, &ldquo;Behold, this dreamer comes.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_37_20" data-osis="Gen.37.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Come now therefore, and let&rsquo;s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, &lsquo;An evil animal has devoured him.&rsquo; We will see what will become of his dreams.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_37_26" data-osis="Gen.37.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Judah said to his brothers, &ldquo;What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?</span>
