<span class="verse Judg_13_1" data-osis="Judg.13.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_2" data-osis="Judg.13.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn&rsquo;t bear.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_3" data-osis="Judg.13.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and said to her, &ldquo;See now, you are barren, and don&rsquo;t bear; but you shall conceive, and bear a son.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_4" data-osis="Judg.13.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don&rsquo;t eat any unclean thing:</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_5" data-osis="Judg.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_6" data-osis="Judg.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, &ldquo;A man of God came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn&rsquo;t ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name:</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_7" data-osis="Judg.13.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>but he said to me, &lsquo;Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_8" data-osis="Judg.13.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_9" data-osis="Judg.13.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn&rsquo;t with her.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_10" data-osis="Judg.13.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me that day.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_11" data-osis="Judg.13.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, &ldquo;Are you the man who spoke to the woman?&rdquo;<br>He said, “I am.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_12" data-osis="Judg.13.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Manoah said, &ldquo;Now let your words happen. What shall the child&rsquo;s way of life and mission be?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_13" data-osis="Judg.13.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, &ldquo;Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_14" data-osis="Judg.13.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_15" data-osis="Judg.13.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, &ldquo;Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young goat ready for you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_16" data-osis="Judg.13.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, &ldquo;Though you detain me, I won&rsquo;t eat of your bread; and if you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.&rdquo; For Manoah didn&rsquo;t know that he was the angel of Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_17" data-osis="Judg.13.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, &ldquo;What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_18" data-osis="Judg.13.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The angel of Yahweh said to him, &ldquo;Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_19" data-osis="Judg.13.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>So Manoah took the young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_20" data-osis="Judg.13.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_21" data-osis="Judg.13.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>But the angel of Yahweh didn&rsquo;t appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_22" data-osis="Judg.13.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Manoah said to his wife, &ldquo;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_13_23" data-osis="Judg.13.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But his wife said to him, &ldquo;If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn&rsquo;t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_24" data-osis="Judg.13.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The woman bore a son, and named him Samson: and the child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_13_25" data-osis="Judg.13.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span>
