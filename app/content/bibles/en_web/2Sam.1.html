<span class="verse 2Sam_1_10" data-osis="2Sam.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Sam_1_11" data-osis="2Sam.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</span>
