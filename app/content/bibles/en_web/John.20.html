<span class="verse John_20_1" data-osis="John.20.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_2" data-osis="John.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know where they have laid him!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_20_3" data-osis="John.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_4" data-osis="John.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_5" data-osis="John.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn&rsquo;t enter in.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_6" data-osis="John.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,</span>
<span class="verse John_20_7" data-osis="John.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_8" data-osis="John.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_9" data-osis="John.20.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For as yet they didn&rsquo;t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_10" data-osis="John.20.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So the disciples went away again to their own homes.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_20_11" data-osis="John.20.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,</span>
<span class="verse John_20_12" data-osis="John.20.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</span>
<span class="verse John_20_13" data-osis="John.20.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They told her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo;<br>She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”</span>
<span class="verse John_20_14" data-osis="John.20.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn&rsquo;t know that it was Jesus.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_20_16" data-osis="John.20.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;</span><br>She turned and said to him, “Rabboni\f + Rabboni is a transliteration of the Hebrew word for “great teacher.”\f*!” which is to say, “Teacher\f + or, Master\f*!”</span>
