<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and the doors shall be shut in the street;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>yes, they shall be afraid of heights,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>before the silver cord is severed,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and the dust returns to the earth as it was,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Vanity of vanities,&rdquo; says the Preacher.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>This is the end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Song.12.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</span>
