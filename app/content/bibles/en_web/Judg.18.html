<span class="verse Judg_18_1" data-osis="Judg.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_2" data-osis="Judg.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, &ldquo;Go, explore the land!&rdquo;<br>They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_3" data-osis="Judg.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, &ldquo;Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_4" data-osis="Judg.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_5" data-osis="Judg.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_6" data-osis="Judg.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The priest said to them, &ldquo;Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_7" data-osis="Judg.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they lived in security, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_8" data-osis="Judg.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_9" data-osis="Judg.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don&rsquo;t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_10" data-osis="Judg.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When you go, you shall come to a secure people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_11" data-osis="Judg.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>There set out from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_12" data-osis="Judg.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_13" data-osis="Judg.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_14" data-osis="Judg.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers, &ldquo;Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_15" data-osis="Judg.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_16" data-osis="Judg.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_17" data-osis="Judg.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_18" data-osis="Judg.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>When these went into Micah&rsquo;s house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_19" data-osis="Judg.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_20" data-osis="Judg.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The priest&rsquo;s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_21" data-osis="Judg.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_22" data-osis="Judg.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah&rsquo;s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_23" data-osis="Judg.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, &ldquo;What ails you, that you come with such a company?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_24" data-osis="Judg.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and what more do I have? How then do you say to me, &lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_25" data-osis="Judg.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The children of Dan said to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_18_26" data-osis="Judg.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_27" data-osis="Judg.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_28" data-osis="Judg.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived therein.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_29" data-osis="Judg.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_30" data-osis="Judg.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_18_31" data-osis="Judg.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>So they set them up Micah&rsquo;s engraved image which he made, all the time that God&rsquo;s house was in Shiloh.</span>
