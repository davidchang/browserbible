<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_1" data-osis="Phlm.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_2" data-osis="Phlm.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_3" data-osis="Phlm.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_4" data-osis="Phlm.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_5" data-osis="Phlm.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_6" data-osis="Phlm.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_7" data-osis="Phlm.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_8" data-osis="Phlm.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_9" data-osis="Phlm.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>yet for love&rsquo;s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_10" data-osis="Phlm.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Onesimus means &ldquo;useful.&rdquo;</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_11" data-osis="Phlm.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_12" data-osis="Phlm.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_13" data-osis="Phlm.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_14" data-osis="Phlm.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_15" data-osis="Phlm.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_16" data-osis="Phlm.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_17" data-osis="Phlm.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_18" data-osis="Phlm.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_19" data-osis="Phlm.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_20" data-osis="Phlm.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_21" data-osis="Phlm.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_22" data-osis="Phlm.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_23" data-osis="Phlm.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_24" data-osis="Phlm.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
<span class="verse Phlm_1_25" data-osis="Phlm.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span>
