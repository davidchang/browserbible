<span class="verse 1Pet_1_7" data-osis="1Pet.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ&mdash;</span>

<span class="verse 1Pet_1_18" data-osis="1Pet.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,</span>
