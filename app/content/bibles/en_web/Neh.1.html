<span class="verse Neh_1_1" data-osis="Neh.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_2" data-osis="Neh.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_3" data-osis="Neh.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They said to me, &ldquo;The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_4" data-osis="Neh.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</span></span>  of heaven,</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_5" data-osis="Neh.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and said, &ldquo;I beg you, Yahweh,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s proper Name, sometimes rendered &ldquo;LORD&rdquo; (all caps) in other translations.</span></span>  the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_6" data-osis="Neh.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father&rsquo;s house have sinned.</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_7" data-osis="Neh.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Neh_1_8" data-osis="Neh.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, &lsquo;If you trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_9" data-osis="Neh.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Neh_1_10" data-osis="Neh.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.</span>
<span class="verse Neh_1_11" data-osis="Neh.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</span></span> , I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.&rdquo;<br>Now I was cup bearer to the king.</span>
