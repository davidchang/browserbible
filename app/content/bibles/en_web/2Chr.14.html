<span class="verse 2Chr_14_1" data-osis="2Chr.14.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_2" data-osis="2Chr.14.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_3" data-osis="2Chr.14.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_4" data-osis="2Chr.14.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_5" data-osis="2Chr.14.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_6" data-osis="2Chr.14.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_7" data-osis="2Chr.14.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For he said to Judah, &ldquo;Let us build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.&rdquo; So they built and prospered.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_8" data-osis="2Chr.14.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_9" data-osis="2Chr.14.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_10" data-osis="2Chr.14.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_11" data-osis="2Chr.14.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, &ldquo;Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don&rsquo;t let man prevail against you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_12" data-osis="2Chr.14.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_13" data-osis="2Chr.14.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_14" data-osis="2Chr.14.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_14_15" data-osis="2Chr.14.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span>
