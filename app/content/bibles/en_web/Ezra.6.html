<span class="verse Ezra_6_1" data-osis="Ezra.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_2" data-osis="Ezra.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>There was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll, and therein was thus written for a record:</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_3" data-osis="Ezra.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning God&rsquo;s house at Jerusalem, let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth sixty cubits;</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_4" data-osis="Ezra.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_5" data-osis="Ezra.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Also let the gold and silver vessels of God&rsquo;s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, everyone to its place; and you shall put them in God&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_6" data-osis="Ezra.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, you must stay far from there.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_7" data-osis="Ezra.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_8" data-osis="Ezra.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Moreover I make a decree what you shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king&rsquo;s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence to these men, that they be not hindered.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_9" data-osis="Ezra.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>That which they have need of, both young bulls, and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_10" data-osis="Ezra.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>that they may offer sacrifices of pleasant aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_11" data-osis="Ezra.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened on it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_12" data-osis="Ezra.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who stretch out their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_13" data-osis="Ezra.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions, because Darius the king had sent a decree, did accordingly with all diligence.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_14" data-osis="Ezra.6.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The elders of the Jews built and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_15" data-osis="Ezra.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>This house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_16" data-osis="Ezra.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_17" data-osis="Ezra.6.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_18" data-osis="Ezra.6.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_19" data-osis="Ezra.6.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The children of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_20" data-osis="Ezra.6.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_21" data-osis="Ezra.6.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel who had come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate,</span>
<span class="verse Ezra_6_22" data-osis="Ezra.6.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of God&rsquo;s house, the God of Israel.</span>
