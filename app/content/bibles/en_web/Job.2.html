<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_1" data-osis="Job.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Again it happened on the day when the God&rsquo;s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_2" data-osis="Job.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo;<br>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_3" data-osis="Job.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_4" data-osis="Job.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_5" data-osis="Job.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_6" data-osis="Job.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, &ldquo;Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_7" data-osis="Job.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_8" data-osis="Job.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_9" data-osis="Job.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then his wife said to him, &ldquo;Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Job_2_10" data-osis="Job.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But he said to her, &ldquo;You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?&rdquo;<br>In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_11" data-osis="Job.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now when Job&rsquo;s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_12" data-osis="Job.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn&rsquo;t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky.</span>
<span class="verse Job_2_13" data-osis="Job.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</span>
