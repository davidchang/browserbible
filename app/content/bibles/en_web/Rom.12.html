<span class="verse Rom_12_1" data-osis="Rom.12.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_2" data-osis="Rom.12.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_3" data-osis="Rom.12.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_4" data-osis="Rom.12.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don&rsquo;t have the same function,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_5" data-osis="Rom.12.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_6" data-osis="Rom.12.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_7" data-osis="Rom.12.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_8" data-osis="Rom.12.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_12_9" data-osis="Rom.12.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_10" data-osis="Rom.12.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_11" data-osis="Rom.12.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_12" data-osis="Rom.12.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_13" data-osis="Rom.12.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_14" data-osis="Rom.12.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don&rsquo;t curse.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_15" data-osis="Rom.12.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_16" data-osis="Rom.12.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don&rsquo;t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don&rsquo;t be wise in your own conceits.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_17" data-osis="Rom.12.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_18" data-osis="Rom.12.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_19" data-osis="Rom.12.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God&rsquo;s wrath. For it is written, &ldquo;Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Deuteronomy 32:35</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rom_12_20" data-osis="Rom.12.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore<br /> &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, feed him.<br /> If he is thirsty, give him a drink;<br /> for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Proverbs 25:21-22</span></span> </span>
