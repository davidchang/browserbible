<span class="verse Acts_10_1" data-osis="Acts.10.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_2" data-osis="Acts.10.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>a devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_3" data-osis="Acts.10.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>At about the ninth hour of the day<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">3:00 PM</span></span> , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, &ldquo;Cornelius!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_4" data-osis="Acts.10.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He, fastening his eyes on him, and being frightened, said, &ldquo;What is it, Lord?&rdquo;<br>He said to him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_5" data-osis="Acts.10.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon, who is also called Peter.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_6" data-osis="Acts.10.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside. <span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR adds &ldquo;This one will tell you what it is necessary for you to do.&rdquo;</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_7" data-osis="Acts.10.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_8" data-osis="Acts.10.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_9" data-osis="Acts.10.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_10" data-osis="Acts.10.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_11" data-osis="Acts.10.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_12" data-osis="Acts.10.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_13" data-osis="Acts.10.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>A voice came to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Rise, Peter, kill and eat!&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_14" data-osis="Acts.10.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, &ldquo;Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_15" data-osis="Acts.10.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>A voice came to him again the second time, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_16" data-osis="Acts.10.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_17" data-osis="Acts.10.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now while Peter was very perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon&rsquo;s house, stood before the gate,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_18" data-osis="Acts.10.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and called and asked whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was lodging there.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_19" data-osis="Acts.10.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, &ldquo;Behold, three <span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Reading from TR and NU. MT omits &ldquo;three&rdquo;</span></span>  men seek you.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_20" data-osis="Acts.10.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_21" data-osis="Acts.10.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Peter went down to the men, and said, &ldquo;Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_22" data-osis="Acts.10.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_23" data-osis="Acts.10.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>So he called them in and lodged them. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_24" data-osis="Acts.10.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_25" data-osis="Acts.10.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>When it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_26" data-osis="Acts.10.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But Peter raised him up, saying, &ldquo;Stand up! I myself am also a man.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_27" data-osis="Acts.10.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_28" data-osis="Acts.10.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn&rsquo;t call any man unholy or unclean.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_29" data-osis="Acts.10.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_30" data-osis="Acts.10.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Cornelius said, &ldquo;Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">3:00 P. M.</span></span>  I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_31" data-osis="Acts.10.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and said, &lsquo;Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_32" data-osis="Acts.10.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is also called Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_33" data-osis="Acts.10.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_34" data-osis="Acts.10.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Peter opened his mouth and said, &ldquo;Truly I perceive that God doesn&rsquo;t show favoritism;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_35" data-osis="Acts.10.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_36" data-osis="Acts.10.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ&mdash;he is Lord of all&mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_37" data-osis="Acts.10.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>you yourselves know what happened, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_38" data-osis="Acts.10.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_39" data-osis="Acts.10.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR omits &ldquo;also&rdquo;</span></span>  killed, hanging him on a tree.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_40" data-osis="Acts.10.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_41" data-osis="Acts.10.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_42" data-osis="Acts.10.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_43" data-osis="Acts.10.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_10_44" data-osis="Acts.10.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_45" data-osis="Acts.10.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_46" data-osis="Acts.10.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.<br>Then Peter answered,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_47" data-osis="Acts.10.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can anyone forbid these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just like us.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_10_48" data-osis="Acts.10.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.</span>
