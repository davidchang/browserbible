<span class="verse Mic_7_2" data-osis="Mic.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The godly man has perished out of the earth,<br /> and there is no one upright among men.<br /> They all lie in wait for blood;<br /> every man hunts his brother with a net.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_3" data-osis="Mic.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.<br /> The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;<br /> and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.<br /> Thus they conspire together.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_4" data-osis="Mic.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The best of them is like a brier.<br /> The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.<br /> The day of your watchmen,<br /> even your visitation, has come;<br /> now is the time of their confusion.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_5" data-osis="Mic.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t trust in a neighbor.<br /> Don&rsquo;t put confidence in a friend.<br /> With the woman lying in your embrace,<br /> be careful of the words of your mouth!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_6" data-osis="Mic.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For the son dishonors the father,<br /> the daughter rises up against her mother,<br /> the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br /> a man&rsquo;s enemies are the men of his own house.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_7" data-osis="Mic.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.<br /> I will wait for the God of my salvation.<br /> My God will hear me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_8" data-osis="Mic.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t rejoice against me, my enemy.<br /> When I fall, I will arise.<br /> When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_9" data-osis="Mic.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,<br /> because I have sinned against him,<br /> until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me.<br /> He will bring me out to the light.<br /> I will see his righteousness.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_10" data-osis="Mic.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then my enemy will see it,<br /> and shame will cover her who said to me,<br /> where is Yahweh your God?<br /> Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame.<br /> Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_11" data-osis="Mic.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>A day to build your walls&mdash;<br /> In that day, he will extend your boundary.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_12" data-osis="Mic.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br /> and from Egypt even to the River,<br /> and from sea to sea,<br /> and mountain to mountain.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_13" data-osis="Mic.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,<br /> for the fruit of their doings.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_14" data-osis="Mic.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Shepherd your people with your staff,<br /> the flock of your heritage,<br /> who dwell by themselves in a forest,<br /> in the midst of fertile pasture land, let them feed;<br /> in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_15" data-osis="Mic.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt,<br /> I will show them marvelous things.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_16" data-osis="Mic.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.<br /> They will lay their hand on their mouth.<br /> Their ears will be deaf.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_17" data-osis="Mic.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>They will lick the dust like a serpent.<br /> Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.<br /> They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,<br /> and will be afraid because of you.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_18" data-osis="Mic.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,<br /> and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?<br /> He doesn&rsquo;t retain his anger forever,<br /> because he delights in loving kindness.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_19" data-osis="Mic.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>He will again have compassion on us.<br /> He will tread our iniquities under foot;<br /> and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_7_20" data-osis="Mic.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>You will give truth to Jacob,<br /> and mercy to Abraham,<br /> as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</span>
