<span class="verse Gen_24_10" data-osis="Gen.24.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The servant took ten camels, of his master&rsquo;s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master&rsquo;s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_11" data-osis="Gen.24.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_15" data-osis="Gen.24.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&rsquo;s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_16" data-osis="Gen.24.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_17" data-osis="Gen.24.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The servant ran to meet her, and said, &ldquo;Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_18" data-osis="Gen.24.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>She said, &ldquo;Drink, my lord.&rdquo; She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_19" data-osis="Gen.24.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>When she had done giving him drink, she said, &ldquo;I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_22" data-osis="Gen.24.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_23" data-osis="Gen.24.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and said, &ldquo;Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father&rsquo;s house for us to lodge in?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_27" data-osis="Gen.24.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of my master&rsquo;s relatives.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_29" data-osis="Gen.24.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_30" data-osis="Gen.24.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister&rsquo;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, &ldquo;This is what the man said to me,&rdquo; that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_31" data-osis="Gen.24.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_24_32" data-osis="Gen.24.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_33" data-osis="Gen.24.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Food was set before him to eat, but he said, &ldquo;I will not eat until I have told my message.&rdquo;<br>He said, “Speak on.”</span>

<span class="verse Gen_24_39" data-osis="Gen.24.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>I asked my master, &lsquo;What if the woman will not follow me?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_40" data-osis="Gen.24.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>He said to me, &lsquo;Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_41" data-osis="Gen.24.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don&rsquo;t give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_42" data-osis="Gen.24.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>I came this day to the spring, and said, &lsquo;Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go&mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_43" data-osis="Gen.24.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, &ldquo;Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_44" data-osis="Gen.24.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>and she will tell me, &ldquo;Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,&rdquo;&mdash;let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_45" data-osis="Gen.24.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, &lsquo;Please let me drink.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_46" data-osis="Gen.24.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, &lsquo;Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.&rsquo; So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_47" data-osis="Gen.24.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>I asked her, and said, &lsquo;Whose daughter are you?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&rsquo;s son, whom Milcah bore to him.&rsquo; I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_48" data-osis="Gen.24.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s daughter for his son.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_24_49" data-osis="Gen.24.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.&rdquo;</span>
