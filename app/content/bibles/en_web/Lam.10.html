<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t learn the way of the nations, and don&rsquo;t be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations are dismayed at them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and don&rsquo;t speak: they must be carried, because they can&rsquo;t go. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of them; for they can&rsquo;t do evil, neither is it in them to do good.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>There is no one like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name is great in might.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Who should not fear you, King of the nations? For it belongs to you; because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is no one like you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>You shall say this to them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings the wind out of his treasuries.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Every man has become brutish and without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is his name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Gather up your wares out of the land, you who live under siege.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children have gone away from me, and they are no more. There is no one to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Yahweh: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, correct me, but in measure: not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.10.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Pour out your wrath on the nations that don&rsquo;t know you, and on the families that don&rsquo;t call on your name: for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span>
