<span class="verse 1Thess_5_3" data-osis="1Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For when they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety,&rdquo; then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_4" data-osis="1Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers, aren&rsquo;t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</span>

<span class="verse 1Thess_5_7" data-osis="1Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_8" data-osis="1Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_9" data-osis="1Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For God didn&rsquo;t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_10" data-osis="1Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</span>
