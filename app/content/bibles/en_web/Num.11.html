<span class="verse Num_11_1" data-osis="Num.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and Yahweh&rsquo;s fire burnt among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_2" data-osis="Num.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.</span>

<span class="verse Num_11_4" data-osis="Num.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, &ldquo;Who will give us flesh to eat?</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_5" data-osis="Num.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_6" data-osis="Num.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_7" data-osis="Num.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_8" data-osis="Num.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_9" data-osis="Num.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.</span>

<span class="verse Num_11_10" data-osis="Num.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_11" data-osis="Num.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Yahweh, &ldquo;Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven&rsquo;t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_12" data-osis="Num.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, &lsquo;Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_13" data-osis="Num.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, &lsquo;Give us meat, that we may eat.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_14" data-osis="Num.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span>

<span class="verse Num_11_25" data-osis="Num.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_26" data-osis="Num.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span>
<span class="verse Num_11_27" data-osis="Num.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, &ldquo;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!&rdquo;</span>
