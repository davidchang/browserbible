<span class="verse Isa_49_1" data-osis="Isa.49.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Listen, islands, to me; and listen, you peoples, from far: Yahweh has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_2" data-osis="Isa.49.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand, he has hidden me: and he has made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he kept me close:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_3" data-osis="Isa.49.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and he said to me, &ldquo;You are my servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_4" data-osis="Isa.49.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But I said, &ldquo;I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh, and my reward with my God.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_5" data-osis="Isa.49.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now says Yahweh who formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of Yahweh, and my God has become my strength);</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_6" data-osis="Isa.49.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>yes, he says, &ldquo;It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_7" data-osis="Isa.49.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: &ldquo;Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_8" data-osis="Isa.49.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;In an acceptable time have I answered you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you; and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_9" data-osis="Isa.49.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>saying to those who are bound, &lsquo;Come out!&rsquo;; to those who are in darkness, &lsquo;Show yourselves!&rsquo;</span>
<br /> &ldquo;They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.<br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_10" data-osis="Isa.49.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide them.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_11" data-osis="Isa.49.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_12" data-osis="Isa.49.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Behold, these shall come from far; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_13" data-osis="Isa.49.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break out into singing, mountains: for Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_14" data-osis="Isa.49.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>But Zion said, &ldquo;Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_15" data-osis="Isa.49.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you!</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_16" data-osis="Isa.49.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_17" data-osis="Isa.49.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go out from you.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_18" data-osis="Isa.49.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Lift up your eyes all around, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and dress yourself with them, like a bride.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_19" data-osis="Isa.49.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_20" data-osis="Isa.49.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too small for me; give place to me that I may dwell.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_21" data-osis="Isa.49.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Then you will say in your heart, &lsquo;Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_22" data-osis="Isa.49.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh, &ldquo;Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_23" data-osis="Isa.49.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_24" data-osis="Isa.49.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_49_25" data-osis="Isa.49.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the plunder of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_49_26" data-osis="Isa.49.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.&rdquo;</span>
