<span class="verse Jer_3_1" data-osis="Jer.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;They say, &lsquo;If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man&rsquo;s, will he return to her again?&rsquo; Wouldn&rsquo;t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_2" data-osis="Jer.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat for them by the ways, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_3" data-osis="Jer.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute&rsquo;s forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_4" data-osis="Jer.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Will you not from this time cry to me, &lsquo;My Father, you are the guide of my youth?&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_5" data-osis="Jer.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?&rsquo; Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_6" data-osis="Jer.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, &ldquo;Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the prostitute.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_7" data-osis="Jer.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I said after she had done all these things, &lsquo;She will return to me;&rsquo; but she didn&rsquo;t return; and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_8" data-osis="Jer.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, didn&rsquo;t fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_9" data-osis="Jer.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>It happened through the lightness of her prostitution, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_10" data-osis="Jer.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_11" data-osis="Jer.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_12" data-osis="Jer.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, &lsquo;Return, you backsliding Israel,&rsquo; says Yahweh; &lsquo;I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,&rsquo; says Yahweh. &lsquo;I will not keep anger forever.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_13" data-osis="Jer.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,&rsquo; says Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_14" data-osis="Jer.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Return, backsliding children,&rdquo; says Yahweh; &ldquo;for I am a husband to you. I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_15" data-osis="Jer.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_16" data-osis="Jer.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;they shall say no more, &lsquo;The ark of the covenant of Yahweh!&rsquo; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_17" data-osis="Jer.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>At that time they shall call Jerusalem &lsquo;The throne of Yahweh;&rsquo; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to Yahweh&rsquo;s name, to Jerusalem. Neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_18" data-osis="Jer.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_19" data-osis="Jer.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But I said, &lsquo;How I would put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;You shall call me &ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; and shall not turn away from following me.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_3_20" data-osis="Jer.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_21" data-osis="Jer.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_22" data-osis="Jer.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding.<br>“Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_23" data-osis="Jer.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Truly in vain is help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_24" data-osis="Jer.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_3_25" data-osis="Jer.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.&rdquo;</span>
