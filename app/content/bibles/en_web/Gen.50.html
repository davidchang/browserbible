<span class="verse Gen_50_15" data-osis="Gen.50.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, &ldquo;It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_50_16" data-osis="Gen.50.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They sent a message to Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Your father commanded before he died, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Gen_50_17" data-osis="Gen.50.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;You shall tell Joseph, &ldquo;Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.&rdquo; Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_50_21" data-osis="Gen.50.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Now therefore don&rsquo;t be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones.&rdquo; He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.</span>
