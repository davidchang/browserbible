<span class="verse Ezek_37_1" data-osis="Ezek.37.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_2" data-osis="Ezek.37.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_3" data-osis="Ezek.37.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? I answered, Lord Yahweh, you know.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_4" data-osis="Ezek.37.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_5" data-osis="Ezek.37.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_6" data-osis="Ezek.37.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_7" data-osis="Ezek.37.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_8" data-osis="Ezek.37.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_9" data-osis="Ezek.37.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_10" data-osis="Ezek.37.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_11" data-osis="Ezek.37.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_12" data-osis="Ezek.37.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_13" data-osis="Ezek.37.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_14" data-osis="Ezek.37.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and you shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_15" data-osis="Ezek.37.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_16" data-osis="Ezek.37.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_17" data-osis="Ezek.37.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_18" data-osis="Ezek.37.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_19" data-osis="Ezek.37.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_20" data-osis="Ezek.37.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_21" data-osis="Ezek.37.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_22" data-osis="Ezek.37.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_23" data-osis="Ezek.37.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_24" data-osis="Ezek.37.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_25" data-osis="Ezek.37.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children&rsquo;s children, forever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_26" data-osis="Ezek.37.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forever more.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_27" data-osis="Ezek.37.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_37_28" data-osis="Ezek.37.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in their midst forever more.</span>
