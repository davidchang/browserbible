<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn&rsquo;t satisfy? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, you shall call a nation that you don&rsquo;t know; and a nation that didn&rsquo;t know you shall run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Seek Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while he is near:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For as the heavens are higher than the earth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>so shall my word be that goes out of my mouth:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For you shall go out with joy,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jer.55.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.&rdquo;</span>
