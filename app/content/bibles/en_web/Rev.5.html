<span class="verse Rev_5_1" data-osis="Rev.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_2" data-osis="Rev.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_3" data-osis="Rev.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_4" data-osis="Rev.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_5" data-osis="Rev.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>One of the elders said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_6" data-osis="Rev.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_7" data-osis="Rev.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_8" data-osis="Rev.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_9" data-osis="Rev.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They sang a new song, saying,<br /> &ldquo;You are worthy to take the book,<br /> and to open its seals:<br /> for you were killed,<br /> and bought us for God with your blood,<br /> out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_10" data-osis="Rev.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and made us kings and priests to our God,<br /> and we will reign on earth.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Rev_5_11" data-osis="Rev.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;</span>
<span class="verse Rev_5_12" data-osis="Rev.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_5_13" data-osis="Rev.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, &ldquo;To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR omits &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</span></span> &rdquo;</span>
