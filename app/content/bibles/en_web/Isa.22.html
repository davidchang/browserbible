<span class="verse Isa_22_2" data-osis="Isa.22.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_3" data-osis="Isa.22.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_4" data-osis="Isa.22.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore I said, &ldquo;Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don&rsquo;t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_5" data-osis="Isa.22.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_6" data-osis="Isa.22.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_7" data-osis="Isa.22.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_8" data-osis="Isa.22.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_9" data-osis="Isa.22.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_10" data-osis="Isa.22.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_11" data-osis="Isa.22.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn&rsquo;t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_12" data-osis="Isa.22.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_13" data-osis="Isa.22.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: &ldquo;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_14" data-osis="Isa.22.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, &ldquo;Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,&rdquo; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Isa_22_15" data-osis="Isa.22.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_16" data-osis="Isa.22.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?&rsquo; Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_17" data-osis="Isa.22.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_18" data-osis="Isa.22.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your lord&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_19" data-osis="Isa.22.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.</span>

<span class="verse Isa_22_21" data-osis="Isa.22.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_22" data-osis="Isa.22.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_23" data-osis="Isa.22.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_24" data-osis="Isa.22.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>They will hang on him all the glory of his father&rsquo;s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_22_25" data-osis="Isa.22.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way.
