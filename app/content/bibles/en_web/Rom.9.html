<span class="verse Rom_9_6" data-osis="Rom.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_7" data-osis="Rom.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Neither, because they are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, are they all children.

<span class="verse Rom_9_9" data-osis="Rom.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For this is a word of promise, &ldquo;At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 18:10,14</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_10" data-osis="Rom.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_11" data-osis="Rom.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">NA puts the phrase &ldquo;not of works, but of him who calls&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 12 instead of the end of verse 11.</span></span> </span>

<span class="verse Rom_9_14" data-osis="Rom.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_15" data-osis="Rom.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For he said to Moses, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 33:19</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_16" data-osis="Rom.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_17" data-osis="Rom.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 9:16</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_18" data-osis="Rom.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_19" data-osis="Rom.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>You will say then to me, &ldquo;Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_20" data-osis="Rom.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God?

<span class="verse Rom_9_23" data-osis="Rom.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_24" data-osis="Rom.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_25" data-osis="Rom.9.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>As he says also in Hosea,<br /> &ldquo;I will call them &lsquo;my people,&rsquo; which were not my people;<br /> and her &lsquo;beloved,&rsquo; who was not beloved.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Hosea 2:23</span></span> <br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_26" data-osis="Rom.9.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;It will be that in the place where it was said to them, &lsquo;You are not my people,&rsquo;<br /> There they will be called &lsquo;children of the living God.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Hosea 1:10</span></span> </span>

<p>
<span class="verse Rom_9_27" data-osis="Rom.9.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Isaiah cries concerning Israel,<br /> &ldquo;If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea,<br /> it is the remnant who will be saved;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_28" data-osis="Rom.9.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness,<br /> because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 10:22-23</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_9_29" data-osis="Rom.9.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>As Isaiah has said before,<br /> &ldquo;Unless the Lord of Armies<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Greek: Sabaoth (for Hebrew: Tze&rsquo;va&rsquo;ot)</span></span>  had left us a seed,<br /> we would have become like Sodom,<br /> and would have been made like Gomorrah.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 1:9</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_9_30" data-osis="Rom.9.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn&rsquo;t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_31" data-osis="Rom.9.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn&rsquo;t arrive at the law of righteousness.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_32" data-osis="Rom.9.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_9_33" data-osis="Rom.9.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>even as it is written,<br /> &ldquo;Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense;<br /> and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 8:14; 28:16</span></span> </span>
