<span class="verse Lam_1_1" data-osis="Lam.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>How the city sits solitary, that was full of people!<br /> She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations!<br /> She who was a princess among the provinces has become tributary!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_2" data-osis="Lam.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks;<br /> among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her:<br /> All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_3" data-osis="Lam.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude;<br /> she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest:<br /> all her persecutors overtook her within the straits.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_4" data-osis="Lam.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because no one come to the solemn assembly;<br /> all her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:<br /> her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_5" data-osis="Lam.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper;<br /> for Yahweh<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; is God&rsquo;s proper Name, sometimes rendered &ldquo;LORD&rdquo; (all caps) in other translations.</span></span>  has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:<br /> her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_6" data-osis="Lam.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>From the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:<br /> her princes are become like deer that find no pasture,<br /> they are gone without strength before the pursuer.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_7" data-osis="Lam.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old:<br /> when her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and no one helped her,<br /> The adversaries saw her, they mocked at her desolations.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_8" data-osis="Lam.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become as an unclean thing;<br /> all who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:<br /> yes, she sighs, and turns backward.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_9" data-osis="Lam.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn&rsquo;t remember her latter end;<br /> therefore is she come down wonderfully; she has no comforter:<br /> see, Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_10" data-osis="Lam.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things:<br /> for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,<br /> concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_11" data-osis="Lam.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>All her people sigh, they seek bread;<br /> they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul:<br /> look, Yahweh, and see; for I am become abject.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_12" data-osis="Lam.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?<br /> Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought on me,<br /> With which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_13" data-osis="Lam.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>From on high has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them;<br /> He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back:<br /> He has made me desolate and faint all the day.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_14" data-osis="Lam.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;<br /> They are knit together, they have come up on my neck; he has made my strength to fail:<br /> The Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</span></span>  has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_15" data-osis="Lam.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me;<br /> He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:<br /> The Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter of Judah.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_16" data-osis="Lam.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water;<br /> Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me:<br /> My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_17" data-osis="Lam.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Zion spreads out her hands; there is no one to comfort her;<br /> Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are around him should be his adversaries:<br /> Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_18" data-osis="Lam.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:<br /> Please hear all you peoples, and see my sorrow:<br /> My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_19" data-osis="Lam.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me:<br /> My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,<br /> While they sought them food to refresh their souls.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_20" data-osis="Lam.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>See, Yahweh; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;<br /> My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:<br /> Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_21" data-osis="Lam.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They have heard that I sigh; there is no one to comfort me;<br /> All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it:<br /> You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, and they shall be like me.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_1_22" data-osis="Lam.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Let all their wickedness come before you;<br /> Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions:<br /> For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</span>
