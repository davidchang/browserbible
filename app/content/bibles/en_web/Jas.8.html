<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, &ldquo;See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.&rdquo;\x + Exodus 25:40\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For finding fault with them, he said,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,<span class="note"> <dfn>+ TR reads &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;fellow citizen&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>In that he says, &ldquo;A new covenant,&rdquo; he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</span>
