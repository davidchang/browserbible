<span class="verse Judg_20_1" data-osis="Judg.20.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_2" data-osis="Judg.20.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_3" data-osis="Judg.20.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, &ldquo;Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Judg_20_4" data-osis="Judg.20.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, &ldquo;I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_5" data-osis="Judg.20.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They thought to have slain me, and they forced my concubine, and she is dead.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_6" data-osis="Judg.20.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_7" data-osis="Judg.20.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_8" data-osis="Judg.20.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>All the people arose as one man, saying, &ldquo;None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to his house.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_9" data-osis="Judg.20.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_10" data-osis="Judg.20.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_11" data-osis="Judg.20.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_12" data-osis="Judg.20.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, &ldquo;What wickedness is this that is happen among you?</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_13" data-osis="Judg.20.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.&rdquo;<br>But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_14" data-osis="Judg.20.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_19" data-osis="Judg.20.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_20" data-osis="Judg.20.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_21" data-osis="Judg.20.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty-two thousand men.</span>

<p>

<span class="verse Judg_20_26" data-osis="Judg.20.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_27" data-osis="Judg.20.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_28" data-osis="Judg.20.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, &ldquo;Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?&rdquo;<br>Yahweh said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_29" data-osis="Judg.20.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_30" data-osis="Judg.20.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_31" data-osis="Judg.20.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_32" data-osis="Judg.20.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>The children of Benjamin said, &ldquo;They are struck down before us, as at the first.&rdquo; But the children of Israel said, &ldquo;Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Judg_20_33" data-osis="Judg.20.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_34" data-osis="Judg.20.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they didn&rsquo;t know that evil was close on them.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_35" data-osis="Judg.20.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_36" data-osis="Judg.20.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_37" data-osis="Judg.20.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_38" data-osis="Judg.20.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_39" data-osis="Judg.20.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, &ldquo;Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_40" data-osis="Judg.20.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_41" data-osis="Judg.20.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_42" data-osis="Judg.20.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_43" data-osis="Judg.20.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_44" data-osis="Judg.20.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_45" data-osis="Judg.20.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_46" data-osis="Judg.20.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_47" data-osis="Judg.20.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months.</span>
<span class="verse Judg_20_48" data-osis="Judg.20.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.</span>
