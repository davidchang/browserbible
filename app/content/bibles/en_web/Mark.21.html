<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>saying to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, &lsquo;The Lord needs them,&rsquo; and immediately he will send them.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Tell the daughter of Zion,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, &ldquo;Hosanna</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The multitudes said, &ldquo;This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers&rsquo; tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer,&rsquo;</span>\x + Isaiah 56:7\x*<span class="woc"> but you have made it a den of robbers!&rdquo;</span>\x + Jeremiah 7:11\x*</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the son of David!&rdquo; they were indignant,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and said to him, &ldquo;Do you hear what these are saying?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let there be no fruit from you forever!&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, &ldquo;How did the fig tree immediately wither away?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don&rsquo;t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, &lsquo;Be taken up and cast into the sea,&rsquo; it would be done. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, &ldquo;By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>But if we say, &lsquo;From men,&rsquo; we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>They answered Jesus, and said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, &lsquo;Son, go work today in my vineyard.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He answered, &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; but afterward he changed his mind, and went. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, &lsquo;I go, sir,&rsquo; but he didn&rsquo;t go. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which of the two did the will of his father?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn&rsquo;t believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn&rsquo;t even repent afterward, that you might believe him. </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, &lsquo;They will respect my son.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, &lsquo;This is the heir. Come, let&rsquo;s kill him, and seize his inheritance.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>They told him, &ldquo;He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Did you never read in the Scriptures, </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.21.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.</span>
