<span class="verse Exod_1_1" data-osis="Exod.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_2" data-osis="Exod.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_3" data-osis="Exod.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_4" data-osis="Exod.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_5" data-osis="Exod.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>All the souls who came out of Jacob&rsquo;s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_6" data-osis="Exod.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_7" data-osis="Exod.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_1_8" data-osis="Exod.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn&rsquo;t know Joseph.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_9" data-osis="Exod.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He said to his people, &ldquo;Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_10" data-osis="Exod.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_11" data-osis="Exod.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_12" data-osis="Exod.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_13" data-osis="Exod.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_14" data-osis="Exod.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_1_15" data-osis="Exod.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_16" data-osis="Exod.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and he said, &ldquo;When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_17" data-osis="Exod.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But the midwives feared God,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</span></span>  and didn&rsquo;t do what the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_18" data-osis="Exod.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, &ldquo;Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_1_19" data-osis="Exod.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The midwives said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Because the Hebrew women aren&rsquo;t like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_1_20" data-osis="Exod.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_21" data-osis="Exod.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_1_22" data-osis="Exod.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, &ldquo;You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.&rdquo;</span>
