<span class="verse Gen_45_5" data-osis="Gen.45.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now don&rsquo;t be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_6" data-osis="Gen.45.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_7" data-osis="Gen.45.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_8" data-osis="Gen.45.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So now it wasn&rsquo;t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_9" data-osis="Gen.45.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, &lsquo;This is what your son Joseph says, &ldquo;God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don&rsquo;t wait.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_10" data-osis="Gen.45.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children&rsquo;s children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_11" data-osis="Gen.45.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_12" data-osis="Gen.45.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_45_17" data-osis="Gen.45.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, &ldquo;Tell your brothers, &lsquo;Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_45_18" data-osis="Gen.45.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse Gen_45_20" data-osis="Gen.45.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Also, don&rsquo;t concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours.&rdquo;</span>
