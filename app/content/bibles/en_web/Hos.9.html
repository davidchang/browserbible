<span class="verse Hos_9_1" data-osis="Hos.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;<br /> for you were unfaithful to your God.<br /> You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_2" data-osis="Hos.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The threshing floor and the wine press won&rsquo;t feed them,<br /> and the new wine will fail her.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_3" data-osis="Hos.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They won&rsquo;t dwell in Yahweh&rsquo;s land;<br /> but Ephraim will return to Egypt,<br /> and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_4" data-osis="Hos.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They won&rsquo;t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,<br /> neither will they be pleasing to him.<br /> Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;<br /> all who eat of it will be polluted;<br /> for their bread will be for their appetite.<br /> It will not come into the house of Yahweh.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_5" data-osis="Hos.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,<br /> and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_6" data-osis="Hos.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.<br /> Egypt will gather them up.<br /> Memphis will bury them.<br /> Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.<br /> Thorns will be in their tents.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_7" data-osis="Hos.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The days of visitation have come.<br /> The days of reckoning have come.<br /> Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,<br /> and the man who is inspired to be insane,<br /> because of the abundance of your sins,<br /> and because your hostility is great.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_8" data-osis="Hos.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.<br /> A fowler&rsquo;s snare is on all of his paths,<br /> and hostility in the house of his God.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_9" data-osis="Hos.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They have deeply corrupted themselves,<br /> as in the days of Gibeah.<br /> He will remember their iniquity.<br /> He will punish them for their sins.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_10" data-osis="Hos.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.<br /> I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;<br /> but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,<br /> and became abominable like that which they loved.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_11" data-osis="Hos.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.<br /> There will be no birth, no one with child, and no conception.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_12" data-osis="Hos.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Though they bring up their children,<br /> yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.<br /> Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_13" data-osis="Hos.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;<br /> but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_14" data-osis="Hos.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Give them&mdash;Yahweh what will you give?<br /> Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_9_15" data-osis="Hos.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;All their wickedness is in Gilgal;<br /> for there I hated them.<br /> Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house!<br /> I will love them no more.<br /> All their princes are rebels.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_9_16" data-osis="Hos.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is struck.<br /> Their root has dried up.<br /> They will bear no fruit.<br /> Even though they give birth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_9_17" data-osis="Hos.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him;<br /> and they will be wanderers among the nations.</span>
