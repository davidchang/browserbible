<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be partakers with them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore he says, &ldquo;Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.&rdquo;\x + Genesis 2:24\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.5.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span>
