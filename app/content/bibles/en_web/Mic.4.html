<span class="verse Mic_4_1" data-osis="Mic.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But in the latter days,<br /> it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh&rsquo;s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,<br /> and it will be exalted above the hills;<br /> and peoples will stream to it.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_2" data-osis="Mic.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Many nations will go and say,<br /> &ldquo;Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,<br /> and to the house of the God of Jacob;<br /> and he will teach us of his ways,<br /> and we will walk in his paths.&rdquo;<br /> For the law will go out of Zion,<br /> and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_3" data-osis="Mic.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>and he will judge between many peoples,<br /> and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.<br /> They will beat their swords into plowshares,<br /> and their spears into pruning hooks.<br /> Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br /> neither will they learn war any more.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_4" data-osis="Mic.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;<br /> and no one will make them afraid:<br /> For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.</span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_5" data-osis="Mic.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;<br /> but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_6" data-osis="Mic.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; says Yahweh,<br /> &ldquo;I will assemble that which is lame,<br /> and I will gather that which is driven away,<br /> and that which I have afflicted;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_7" data-osis="Mic.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and I will make that which was lame a remnant,<br /> and that which was cast far off a strong nation:<br /> and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_8" data-osis="Mic.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,<br /> to you it will come,<br /> yes, the former dominion will come,<br /> the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_9" data-osis="Mic.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Now why do you cry out aloud?<br /> Is there no king in you?<br /> Has your counselor perished,<br /> that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_10" data-osis="Mic.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,<br /> like a woman in travail;<br /> for now you will go out of the city,<br /> and will dwell in the field,<br /> and will come even to Babylon.<br /> There you will be rescued.<br /> There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_11" data-osis="Mic.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,<br /> &ldquo;Let her be defiled,<br /> and let our eye gloat over Zion.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_12" data-osis="Mic.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But they don&rsquo;t know the thoughts of Yahweh,<br /> neither do they understand his counsel;<br /> for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_4_13" data-osis="Mic.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;<br /> for I will make your horn iron,<br /> and I will make your hoofs brass;<br /> and you will beat in pieces many peoples:<br /> and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,<br /> and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.</span>
