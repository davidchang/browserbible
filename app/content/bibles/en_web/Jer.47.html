<span class="verse Jer_47_1" data-osis="Jer.47.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_2" data-osis="Jer.47.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_3" data-osis="Jer.47.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers don&rsquo;t look back to their children for feebleness of hands;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_4" data-osis="Jer.47.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_5" data-osis="Jer.47.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_6" data-osis="Jer.47.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet? Put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_47_7" data-osis="Jer.47.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>How can you be quiet, since Yahweh has given you a command? Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has he appointed it.</span>
