<span class="verse Jer_1_4" data-osis="Jer.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_5" data-osis="Jer.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came out of the womb, I sanctified you. I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_6" data-osis="Jer.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &ldquo;Ah, Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</span></span>  Yahweh! Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

<span class="verse Jer_1_7" data-osis="Jer.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;I am a child;&rsquo; for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_8" data-osis="Jer.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_9" data-osis="Jer.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_10" data-osis="Jer.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_11" data-osis="Jer.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, &ldquo;Jeremiah, what do you see?&rdquo;<br>I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_1_12" data-osis="Jer.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Jer_1_14" data-osis="Jer.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Out of the north evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_15" data-osis="Jer.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,&rdquo; says Yahweh; &ldquo;and they shall come, and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_1_16" data-osis="Jer.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</span>
