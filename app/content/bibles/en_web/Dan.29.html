<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Speak and say, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord Yahweh: &ldquo;Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies in the midst of his rivers, that has said, &lsquo;My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;ll cast you out into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers. You&rsquo;ll fall on the open field. You won&rsquo;t be brought together, nor gathered. I have given you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke, and paralyzed all of their thighs.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: &ldquo;Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. Because he has said, &lsquo;The river is mine, and I have made it;&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For thus says the Lord Yahweh: &ldquo;At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her plunder, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.29.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>In that day will I cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth in their midst; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
