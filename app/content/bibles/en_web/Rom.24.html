<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, &ldquo;Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But, that I don&rsquo;t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.<span class="note"> <dfn>+ TR adds &ldquo;We wanted to judge him according to our law,&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ TR adds &ldquo;but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ TR adds &ldquo;commanding his accusers to come to you.&rdquo;</dfn></span>By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered, &ldquo;Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>In the temple they didn&rsquo;t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, &lsquo;Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, &ldquo;When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, &ldquo;Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often, and talked with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.24.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</span>
