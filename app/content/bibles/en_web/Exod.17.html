<span class="verse Exod_17_7" data-osis="Exod.17.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He called the name of the place Massah,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Massah means testing.</span></span>  and Meribah,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Meribah means quarreling.</span></span>  because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, &ldquo;Is Yahweh among us, or not?&rdquo;</span>
