<span class="verse Phil_4_1" data-osis="Phil.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_2" data-osis="Phil.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_3" data-osis="Phil.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Yes, I beg you also, true partner, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_4" data-osis="Phil.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_5" data-osis="Phil.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_6" data-osis="Phil.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_7" data-osis="Phil.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_4_8" data-osis="Phil.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_9" data-osis="Phil.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_10" data-osis="Phil.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_11" data-osis="Phil.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_12" data-osis="Phil.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_13" data-osis="Phil.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_14" data-osis="Phil.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>However you did well that you shared in my affliction.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_15" data-osis="Phil.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_16" data-osis="Phil.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_17" data-osis="Phil.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_18" data-osis="Phil.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_19" data-osis="Phil.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_20" data-osis="Phil.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_4_21" data-osis="Phil.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_22" data-osis="Phil.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar&rsquo;s household.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_4_23" data-osis="Phil.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span>
