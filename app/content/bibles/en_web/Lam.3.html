<span class="verse Lam_3_6" data-osis="Lam.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_7" data-osis="Lam.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He has walled me about, that I can&rsquo;t go out; he has made my chain heavy.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_8" data-osis="Lam.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_9" data-osis="Lam.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_10" data-osis="Lam.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_11" data-osis="Lam.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_3_12" data-osis="Lam.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br /></span>
