<span class="verse Rev_9_1" data-osis="Rev.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_2" data-osis="Rev.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR adds &ldquo;great&rdquo;</span></span>  burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_3" data-osis="Rev.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_4" data-osis="Rev.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don&rsquo;t have God&rsquo;s seal on their foreheads.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_5" data-osis="Rev.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a person.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_6" data-osis="Rev.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_7" data-osis="Rev.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people&rsquo;s faces.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_8" data-osis="Rev.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They had hair like women&rsquo;s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_9" data-osis="Rev.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_10" data-osis="Rev.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_11" data-osis="Rev.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is &ldquo;Abaddon,&rdquo;<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Abaddon&rdquo; is a Hebrew word that means ruin, destruction, or the place of destruction</span></span>  but in Greek, he has the name &ldquo;Apollyon.&rdquo;<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Apollyon&rdquo; means &ldquo;Destroyer.&rdquo;</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_12" data-osis="Rev.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_9_13" data-osis="Rev.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_14" data-osis="Rev.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, &ldquo;Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rev_9_15" data-osis="Rev.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_16" data-osis="Rev.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">literally, &ldquo;ten thousands of ten thousands&rdquo;</span></span> . I heard the number of them.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_17" data-osis="Rev.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_18" data-osis="Rev.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_19" data-osis="Rev.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_20" data-osis="Rev.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn&rsquo;t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn&rsquo;t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</span>
<span class="verse Rev_9_21" data-osis="Rev.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word for &ldquo;sorceries&rdquo; (pharmakeia) also implies the use of potions, poisons, and drugs</span></span>  nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.</span>
