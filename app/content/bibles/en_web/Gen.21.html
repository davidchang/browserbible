<span class="verse Gen_21_24" data-osis="Gen.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Abraham said, &ldquo;I will swear.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Gen_21_27" data-osis="Gen.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.</span>

<span class="verse Gen_21_29" data-osis="Gen.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Abimelech said to Abraham, &ldquo;What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Gen_21_30" data-osis="Gen.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Gen_21_31" data-osis="Gen.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore he called that place Beersheba,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Beersheba can mean &ldquo;well of the oath&rdquo; or &ldquo;well of seven.&rdquo;</span></span>  because they both swore there.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_21_32" data-osis="Gen.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</span>
