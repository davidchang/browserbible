<span class="verse 1Sam_31_2" data-osis="1Sam.31.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_3" data-osis="1Sam.31.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_4" data-osis="1Sam.31.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Saul said to his armor bearer, &ldquo;Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!&rdquo; But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_5" data-osis="1Sam.31.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died with him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_6" data-osis="1Sam.31.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_7" data-osis="1Sam.31.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_8" data-osis="1Sam.31.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_9" data-osis="1Sam.31.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_10" data-osis="1Sam.31.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_11" data-osis="1Sam.31.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_12" data-osis="1Sam.31.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_31_13" data-osis="1Sam.31.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</span>
