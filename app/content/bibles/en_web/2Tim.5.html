<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Honor widows who are widows indeed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But if anyone doesn&rsquo;t provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints&rsquo; feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For already some have turned aside after Satan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don&rsquo;t let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says, &ldquo;You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.&rdquo;\x + Deuteronomy 25:4\x* And, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&rdquo;</span>\x + Luke 10:7; Leviticus 19:13\x*</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men&rsquo;s sins. Keep yourself pure.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach&rsquo;s sake and your frequent infirmities.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Some men&rsquo;s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can&rsquo;t be hidden.</span>
