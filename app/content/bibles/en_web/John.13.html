<span class="verse John_13_5" data-osis="John.13.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</span>
<span class="verse John_13_6" data-osis="John.13.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, &ldquo;Lord, do you wash my feet?&rdquo;</span>
