<span class="verse Num_5_8" data-osis="Num.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh shall be the priest&rsquo;s; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement shall be made for him.</span>
<span class="verse Num_5_9" data-osis="Num.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.</span>

<span class="verse Num_5_27" data-osis="Num.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people.</span>
<span class="verse Num_5_28" data-osis="Num.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>If the woman isn&rsquo;t defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</span>
