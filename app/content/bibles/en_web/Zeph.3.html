<span class="verse Zeph_3_3" data-osis="Zeph.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_4" data-osis="Zeph.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_5" data-osis="Zeph.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn&rsquo;t fail, but the unjust know no shame.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_6" data-osis="Zeph.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_7" data-osis="Zeph.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I said, &ldquo;Just fear me.

<span class="verse Zeph_3_9" data-osis="Zeph.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on Yahweh&rsquo;s name, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.</span>

<span class="verse Zeph_3_12" data-osis="Zeph.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>But I will leave in your midst an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in Yahweh&rsquo;s name.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_13" data-osis="Zeph.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_14" data-osis="Zeph.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_15" data-osis="Zeph.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in your midst. You will not be afraid of evil any more.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_16" data-osis="Zeph.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Zion. Don&rsquo;t let your hands be weak.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_17" data-osis="Zeph.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, your God, is in your midst, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_18" data-osis="Zeph.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_19" data-osis="Zeph.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Behold,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;הִנֵּה&rdquo;, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</span></span>  at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Zeph_3_20" data-osis="Zeph.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</span>
