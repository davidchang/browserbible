<span class="verse Lam_2_1" data-osis="Lam.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!<br /> He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel,<br /> And hasn&rsquo;t remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_2" data-osis="Lam.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied:<br /> He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;<br /> He has brought them down to the ground; he has profaned the kingdom and its princes.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_3" data-osis="Lam.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel;<br /> He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:<br /> He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours all around.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_4" data-osis="Lam.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>He has bent his bow like an enemy, he has stood with his right hand as an adversary,<br /> Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye:<br /> In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like fire.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_5" data-osis="Lam.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The Lord has become as an enemy, he has swallowed up Israel;<br /> He has swallowed up all her palaces, he has destroyed his strongholds;<br /> He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_6" data-osis="Lam.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he has destroyed his place of assembly:<br /> Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,<br /> Has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_7" data-osis="Lam.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary;<br /> He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:<br /> They have made a noise in the house of Yahweh, as in the day of a solemn assembly.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_8" data-osis="Lam.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;<br /> He has stretched out the line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying;<br /> He has made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_9" data-osis="Lam.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars:<br /> Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;<br /> Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_10" data-osis="Lam.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, they keep silence;<br /> They have cast up dust on their heads; they have clothed themselves with sackcloth:<br /> The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Lam_2_11" data-osis="Lam.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>My eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled;<br /> My liver is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,<br /> Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_12" data-osis="Lam.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They tell their mothers, Where is grain and wine?<br /> When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,<br /> When their soul is poured out into their mothers&rsquo; bosom.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_13" data-osis="Lam.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>What shall I testify to you? what shall I liken to you, daughter of Jerusalem?<br /> What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of Zion?<br /> For your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_14" data-osis="Lam.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions;<br /> They have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captivity,<br /> but have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_15" data-osis="Lam.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>All that pass by clap their hands at you.<br /> They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,<br /> Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_16" data-osis="Lam.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you;<br /> They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;<br /> Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_17" data-osis="Lam.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has done that which he purposed; he has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old;<br /> He has thrown down, and has not pitied:<br /> He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; he has exalted the horn of your adversaries.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_18" data-osis="Lam.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Their heart cried to the Lord:<br /> wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night;<br /> Give yourself no respite; don&rsquo;t let the apple of your eye cease.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_19" data-osis="Lam.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;<br /> Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord:<br /> Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Lam_2_20" data-osis="Lam.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!<br /> Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands?<br /> Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_21" data-osis="Lam.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;<br /> My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:<br /> You have killed them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered, and not pitied.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Lam_2_22" data-osis="Lam.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side;<br /> There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh&rsquo;s anger:<br /> Those that I have dandled and brought up has my enemy consumed.</span>
