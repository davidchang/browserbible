<span class="verse Ezek_15_2" data-osis="Ezek.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_3" data-osis="Ezek.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_4" data-osis="Ezek.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and its midst is burned: is it profitable for any work?</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_5" data-osis="Ezek.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_6" data-osis="Ezek.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_7" data-osis="Ezek.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I will set my face against them; they shall go out from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_15_8" data-osis="Ezek.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
