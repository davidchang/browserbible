<span class="verse John_19_2" data-osis="John.19.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_3" data-osis="John.19.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They kept saying, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo; and they kept slapping him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse John_19_4" data-osis="John.19.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, &ldquo;Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_5" data-osis="John.19.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Behold, the man!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_6" data-osis="John.19.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify!&rdquo;<br>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_7" data-osis="John.19.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered him, &ldquo;We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_8" data-osis="John.19.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was more afraid.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_9" data-osis="John.19.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; But Jesus gave him no answer.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_10" data-osis="John.19.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore said to him, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you speaking to me? Don&rsquo;t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_11" data-osis="John.19.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_12" data-osis="John.19.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, &ldquo;If you release this man, you aren&rsquo;t Caesar&rsquo;s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_13" data-osis="John.19.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called &ldquo;The Pavement,&rdquo; but in Hebrew, &ldquo;Gabbatha.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_14" data-osis="John.19.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour.<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;the sixth hour&rdquo; would have been 6:00 AM according to the Roman timekeeping system, or noon for the Jewish timekeeping system in use, then.</span></span>  He said to the Jews, &ldquo;Behold, your King!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_15" data-osis="John.19.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>They cried out, &ldquo;Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!&rdquo;<br>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”<br>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_16" data-osis="John.19.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_17" data-osis="John.19.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called &ldquo;The Place of a Skull,&rdquo; which is called in Hebrew, &ldquo;Golgotha,&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_18" data-osis="John.19.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_19" data-osis="John.19.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, &ldquo;JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_20" data-osis="John.19.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_21" data-osis="John.19.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write, &lsquo;The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;he said, I am King of the Jews.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_22" data-osis="John.19.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered, &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_23" data-osis="John.19.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_24" data-osis="John.19.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Then they said to one another, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,&rdquo; that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,<br /> &ldquo;They parted my garments among them.<br /> For my cloak they cast lots.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 22:18</span></span> <br>Therefore the soldiers did these things.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_25" data-osis="John.19.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_26" data-osis="John.19.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore when Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Woman, behold your son!&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse John_19_27" data-osis="John.19.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the disciple, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, your mother!&rdquo;</span> From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_28" data-osis="John.19.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus, seeing<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">NU, TR read &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;</span></span>  that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_19_29" data-osis="John.19.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_30" data-osis="John.19.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;</span> He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_31" data-osis="John.19.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn&rsquo;t remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_32" data-osis="John.19.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him;</span>
<span class="verse John_19_33" data-osis="John.19.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn&rsquo;t break his legs.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_34" data-osis="John.19.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>However one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_35" data-osis="John.19.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>He who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may believe.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_36" data-osis="John.19.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, &ldquo;A bone of him will not be broken.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Exodus 12:46; Numbers 9:12; Psalm 34:20</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse John_19_37" data-osis="John.19.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Again another Scripture says, &ldquo;They will look on him whom they pierced.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Zechariah 12:10</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_19_38" data-osis="John.19.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus&rsquo; body. Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_39" data-osis="John.19.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">100 Roman pounds of 12 ounces each, or about 72 pounds, or 33 Kilograms.</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse John_19_40" data-osis="John.19.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>So they took Jesus&rsquo; body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_41" data-osis="John.19.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.</span>
<span class="verse John_19_42" data-osis="John.19.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Then because of the Jews&rsquo; Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.</span>
