<span class="verse Josh_18_1" data-osis="Josh.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_2" data-osis="Josh.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_3" data-osis="Josh.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to the children of Israel, &ldquo;How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_4" data-osis="Josh.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_5" data-osis="Josh.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_6" data-osis="Josh.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_7" data-osis="Josh.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_18_8" data-osis="Josh.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The men arose and went.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Josh_18_9" data-osis="Josh.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.</span>
<span class="verse Josh_18_10" data-osis="Josh.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.</span>
