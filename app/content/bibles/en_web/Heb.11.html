<span class="verse Heb_11_4" data-osis="Heb.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and through it he, being dead, still speaks.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_5" data-osis="Heb.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t see death, and he was not found, because God translated him.

<span class="verse Heb_11_6" data-osis="Heb.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_7" data-osis="Heb.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, reverence</span></span>  prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_8" data-osis="Heb.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_9" data-osis="Heb.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_10" data-osis="Heb.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_11" data-osis="Heb.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_12" data-osis="Heb.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_13" data-osis="Heb.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR adds &ldquo;and being convinced of&rdquo;</span></span>  them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_14" data-osis="Heb.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_15" data-osis="Heb.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_11_16" data-osis="Heb.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_11_17" data-osis="Heb.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son;</span>

<span class="verse Heb_11_23" data-osis="Heb.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king&rsquo;s commandment.</span>
