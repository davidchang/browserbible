<p>
<span class="verse Luke_3_7" data-osis="Luke.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, &ldquo;You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_8" data-osis="Luke.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don&rsquo;t begin to say among yourselves, &lsquo;We have Abraham for our father;&rsquo; for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones!</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_9" data-osis="Luke.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Even now the ax also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn&rsquo;t produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Luke_3_10" data-osis="Luke.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The multitudes asked him, &ldquo;What then must we do?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Luke_3_15" data-osis="Luke.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>As the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_3_16" data-osis="Luke.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>John answered them all, &ldquo;I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen.

<span class="verse Luke_3_19" data-osis="Luke.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother&rsquo;s <span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR reads &ldquo;brother Philip&rsquo;s&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;brother&rsquo;s&rdquo;</span></span>  wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,</span>
