<span class="verse 1Sam_8_7" data-osis="1Sam.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Samuel, &ldquo;Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_8_8" data-osis="1Sam.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_8_9" data-osis="1Sam.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who shall reign over them.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_8_12" data-osis="1Sam.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_8_13" data-osis="1Sam.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_8_14" data-osis="1Sam.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_8_15" data-osis="1Sam.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_8_20" data-osis="1Sam.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.&rdquo;</span>
