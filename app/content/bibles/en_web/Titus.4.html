<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come to me soon,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his works,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.4.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</span>
