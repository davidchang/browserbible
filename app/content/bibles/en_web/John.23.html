<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>They began to accuse him, saying, &ldquo;We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, &ldquo;I find no basis for a charge against this man.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But they insisted, saying, &ldquo;He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When he found out that he was in Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, &ldquo;You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But they all cried out together, saying, &ldquo;Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!&rdquo;&mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>but they shouted, saying, &ldquo;Crucify! Crucify him!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>He said to them the third time, &ldquo;Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, don&rsquo;t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, &lsquo;Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then they will begin to tell the mountains, &lsquo;Fall on us!&rsquo; and tell the hills, &lsquo;Cover us.&rsquo;</span>\x + Hosea 10:8\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they don&rsquo;t know what they are doing.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, &ldquo;He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>and saying, &ldquo;If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: &ldquo;THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, &ldquo;If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>He said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>It was now about the sixth hour<span class="note"> <dfn>+ Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.</dfn></span>, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<span class="note"> <dfn>+ 3:00 PM</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!&rdquo;</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Certainly this was a righteous man.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus&rsquo; body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.23.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span>
