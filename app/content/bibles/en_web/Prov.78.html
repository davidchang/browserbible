<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Hear my teaching, my people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Which we have heard and known,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>We will not hide them from their children,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>that they might set their hope in God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>and might not be as their fathers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t keep God&rsquo;s covenant,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They forgot his doings,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He split rocks in the wilderness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Yet they still went on to sin against him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>They tempted God in their heart</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Yes, they spoke against God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>because they didn&rsquo;t believe in God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Yet he commanded the skies above,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>He rained down manna on them to eat,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Man ate the bread of angels.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>He rained also flesh on them as the dust;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>He let them fall in the midst of their camp,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>So they ate, and were well filled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t turn from their cravings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>when the anger of God went up against them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>For all this they still sinned,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>When he killed them, then they inquired after him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>They remembered that God was their rock,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>For their heart was not right with him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn&rsquo;t destroy them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>He remembered that they were but flesh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>They turned again and tempted God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t remember his hand,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>how he set his signs in Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>he turned their rivers into blood,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>He gave over their livestock also to the hail,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>He made a path for his anger.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>But he led out his own people like sheep,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>He led them safely, so that they weren&rsquo;t afraid,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>He also drove out the nations before them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>When God heard this, he was angry,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>and delivered his strength into captivity,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>He also gave his people over to the sword,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>Fire devoured their young men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>Their priests fell by the sword,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>He struck his adversaries backward.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span>He built his sanctuary like the heights,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>He also chose David his servant,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>from following the ewes that have their young,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Prov.78.72"><span class="verse-num">72&nbsp;</span>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,</span>
