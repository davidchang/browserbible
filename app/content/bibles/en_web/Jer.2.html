<span class="verse Jer_2_1" data-osis="Jer.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_2" data-osis="Jer.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_3" data-osis="Jer.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Israel was holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come on them,&rdquo;&rsquo; says Yahweh.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_4" data-osis="Jer.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_5" data-osis="Jer.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_6" data-osis="Jer.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Neither did they say, &lsquo;Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that no one passed through, and where no man lived?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_7" data-osis="Jer.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_8" data-osis="Jer.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The priests didn&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;Where is Yahweh?&rsquo; and those who handle the law didn&rsquo;t know me. The rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_9" data-osis="Jer.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Therefore I will yet contend with you,&rdquo; says Yahweh, &ldquo;and I will contend with your children&rsquo;s children.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_10" data-osis="Jer.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_11" data-osis="Jer.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Has a nation changed its gods, which really are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_12" data-osis="Jer.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be very desolate,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_13" data-osis="Jer.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and cut them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_14" data-osis="Jer.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Is Israel a servant? Is he a native-born slave? Why has he become a captive?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_15" data-osis="Jer.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The young lions have roared at him, and yelled. They have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_16" data-osis="Jer.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_17" data-osis="Jer.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</span></span> , when he led you by the way?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_18" data-osis="Jer.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_19" data-osis="Jer.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not in you,&rdquo; says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_20" data-osis="Jer.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, &lsquo;I will not serve;&rsquo; for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself, playing the prostitute.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_21" data-osis="Jer.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_22" data-osis="Jer.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me,&rdquo; says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_23" data-osis="Jer.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How can you say, &lsquo;I am not defiled. I have not gone after the Baals&rsquo;? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_24" data-osis="Jer.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire. When she is in heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_25" data-osis="Jer.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst. But you said, &lsquo;It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_26" data-osis="Jer.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_27" data-osis="Jer.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>who tell wood, &lsquo;You are my father;&rsquo; and a stone, &lsquo;You have brought me out:&rsquo; for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, &lsquo;Arise, and save us.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_28" data-osis="Jer.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_29" data-osis="Jer.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why will you contend with me? You all have transgressed against me,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_30" data-osis="Jer.2.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have struck your children in vain. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_31" data-osis="Jer.2.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Generation, consider the word of Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, &lsquo;We have broken loose. We will come to you no more?&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_32" data-osis="Jer.2.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_33" data-osis="Jer.2.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>How well you prepare your way to seek love! Therefore you have taught even the wicked women your ways.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_34" data-osis="Jer.2.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts. You did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jer_2_35" data-osis="Jer.2.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yet you said, &lsquo;I am innocent. Surely his anger has turned away from me.&rsquo;<br>“Behold, I will judge you, because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_36" data-osis="Jer.2.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Why do you go about so much to change your way? You will be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_2_37" data-osis="Jer.2.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>From there also you shall go out, with your hands on your head; for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.</span>
