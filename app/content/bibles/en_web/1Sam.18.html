<span class="verse 1Sam_18_4" data-osis="1Sam.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his sash.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_5" data-osis="1Sam.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul&rsquo;s servants.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_6" data-osis="1Sam.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_7" data-osis="1Sam.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The women sang one to another as they played, and said,<br /> &ldquo;Saul has slain his thousands,<br /> David his ten thousands.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_11" data-osis="1Sam.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and Saul threw the spear; for he said, &ldquo;I will pin David even to the wall!&rdquo; David escaped from his presence twice.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_12" data-osis="1Sam.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_13" data-osis="1Sam.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_18" data-osis="1Sam.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>David said to Saul, &ldquo;Who am I, and what is my life, or my father&rsquo;s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_21" data-osis="1Sam.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_22" data-osis="1Sam.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Saul commanded his servants, &ldquo;Talk with David secretly, and say, &lsquo;Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king&rsquo;s son-in-law.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_23" data-osis="1Sam.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Saul&rsquo;s servants spoke those words in the ears of David.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_24" data-osis="1Sam.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>The servants of Saul told him, saying, &ldquo;David spoke like this.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_18_26" data-osis="1Sam.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>When his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king&rsquo;s son-in-law. The days were not expired;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_27" data-osis="1Sam.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king&rsquo;s son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_28" data-osis="1Sam.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_18_29" data-osis="1Sam.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David&rsquo;s enemy continually.</span>
