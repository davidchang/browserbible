<span class="verse Deut_28_56" data-osis="Deut.28.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_57" data-osis="Deut.28.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>toward her young one who comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_58" data-osis="Deut.28.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_59" data-osis="Deut.28.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>then Yahweh will make your plagues fearful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_60" data-osis="Deut.28.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_61" data-osis="Deut.28.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you, until you are destroyed.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_62" data-osis="Deut.28.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>You will be left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn&rsquo;t listen to Yahweh your God&rsquo;s voice.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_63" data-osis="Deut.28.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you. You will be plucked from off of the land where you go in to possess it.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_64" data-osis="Deut.28.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth.

<span class="verse Deut_28_65" data-osis="Deut.28.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>Among these nations you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_66" data-osis="Deut.28.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_67" data-osis="Deut.28.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>In the morning you will say, &ldquo;I wish it were evening!&rdquo; and at evening you will say, &ldquo;I wish it were morning!&rdquo; for the fear of your heart which you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_28_68" data-osis="Deut.28.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span>Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies for male and female slaves, and nobody will buy you.</span>
