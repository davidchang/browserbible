<span class="verse Eph_5_1" data-osis="Eph.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_2" data-osis="Eph.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_3" data-osis="Eph.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_4" data-osis="Eph.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eph_5_5" data-osis="Eph.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eph_5_6" data-osis="Eph.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_7" data-osis="Eph.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be partakers with them.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_8" data-osis="Eph.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_9" data-osis="Eph.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_10" data-osis="Eph.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_11" data-osis="Eph.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_12" data-osis="Eph.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_13" data-osis="Eph.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_14" data-osis="Eph.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore he says, &ldquo;Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eph_5_15" data-osis="Eph.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_16" data-osis="Eph.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_17" data-osis="Eph.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_18" data-osis="Eph.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_19" data-osis="Eph.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_20" data-osis="Eph.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_21" data-osis="Eph.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eph_5_22" data-osis="Eph.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_23" data-osis="Eph.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_24" data-osis="Eph.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Eph_5_25" data-osis="Eph.5.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_26" data-osis="Eph.5.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_27" data-osis="Eph.5.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_28" data-osis="Eph.5.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_29" data-osis="Eph.5.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_30" data-osis="Eph.5.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_31" data-osis="Eph.5.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 2:24</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_32" data-osis="Eph.5.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.</span>
<span class="verse Eph_5_33" data-osis="Eph.5.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span>
