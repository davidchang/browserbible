<span class="verse Matt_26_1" data-osis="Matt.26.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_2" data-osis="Matt.26.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_3" data-osis="Matt.26.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_4" data-osis="Matt.26.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_5" data-osis="Matt.26.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But they said, &ldquo;Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_6" data-osis="Matt.26.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_7" data-osis="Matt.26.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_8" data-osis="Matt.26.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, &ldquo;Why this waste?</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_9" data-osis="Matt.26.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_10" data-osis="Matt.26.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you trouble the woman? Because she has done a good work for me. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_11" data-osis="Matt.26.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For you always have the poor with you; but you don&rsquo;t always have me. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_12" data-osis="Matt.26.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_13" data-osis="Matt.26.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_14" data-osis="Matt.26.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_15" data-osis="Matt.26.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and said, &ldquo;What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?&rdquo; They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_16" data-osis="Matt.26.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_17" data-osis="Matt.26.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, &ldquo;Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_18" data-osis="Matt.26.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_19" data-osis="Matt.26.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_20" data-osis="Matt.26.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_21" data-osis="Matt.26.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>As they were eating, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_22" data-osis="Matt.26.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t me, is it, Lord?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_23" data-osis="Matt.26.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_24" data-osis="Matt.26.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_25" data-osis="Matt.26.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Judas, who betrayed him, answered, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t me, is it, Rabbi?&rdquo;<br>He said to him, \wj “You said it.”\wj*</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_26" data-osis="Matt.26.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">TR reads &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;gave thanks for&rdquo;</span></span>  it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_27" data-osis="Matt.26.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;All of you drink it, </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_28" data-osis="Matt.26.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_29" data-osis="Matt.26.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father&rsquo;s Kingdom.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_30" data-osis="Matt.26.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_31" data-osis="Matt.26.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, &lsquo;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rsquo;</span><span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Zechariah 13:7</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_32" data-osis="Matt.26.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_33" data-osis="Matt.26.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>But Peter answered him, &ldquo;Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_34" data-osis="Matt.26.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_35" data-osis="Matt.26.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, &ldquo;Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.&rdquo; All of the disciples also said likewise.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_36" data-osis="Matt.26.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sit here, while I go there and pray.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_37" data-osis="Matt.26.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_38" data-osis="Matt.26.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_39" data-osis="Matt.26.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_40" data-osis="Matt.26.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What, couldn&rsquo;t you watch with me for one hour? </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_41" data-osis="Matt.26.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Watch and pray, that you don&rsquo;t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_42" data-osis="Matt.26.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My Father, if this cup can&rsquo;t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_43" data-osis="Matt.26.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_44" data-osis="Matt.26.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_45" data-osis="Matt.26.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_46" data-osis="Matt.26.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Arise, let&rsquo;s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_47" data-osis="Matt.26.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_48" data-osis="Matt.26.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, &ldquo;Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_49" data-osis="Matt.26.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, &ldquo;Hail, Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_50" data-osis="Matt.26.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Friend, why are you here?&rdquo;</span> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_51" data-osis="Matt.26.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_52" data-osis="Matt.26.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_53" data-osis="Matt.26.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or do you think that I couldn&rsquo;t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_54" data-osis="Matt.26.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_55" data-osis="Matt.26.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn&rsquo;t arrest me. </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_56" data-osis="Matt.26.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.&rdquo;</span><br>Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_57" data-osis="Matt.26.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_58" data-osis="Matt.26.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_59" data-osis="Matt.26.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_60" data-osis="Matt.26.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_61" data-osis="Matt.26.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>and said, &ldquo;This man said, &lsquo;I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_62" data-osis="Matt.26.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>The high priest stood up, and said to him, &ldquo;Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_63" data-osis="Matt.26.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, &ldquo;I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_64" data-osis="Matt.26.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_65" data-osis="Matt.26.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, &ldquo;He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_66" data-osis="Matt.26.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>What do you think?&rdquo;<br>They answered, “He is worthy of death!”</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_67" data-osis="Matt.26.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_68" data-osis="Matt.26.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_69" data-osis="Matt.26.69"><span class="verse-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, &ldquo;You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_70" data-osis="Matt.26.70"><span class="verse-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span>But he denied it before them all, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_71" data-osis="Matt.26.71"><span class="verse-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, &ldquo;This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_72" data-osis="Matt.26.72"><span class="verse-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span>Again he denied it with an oath, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_73" data-osis="Matt.26.73"><span class="verse-num v-73">73&nbsp;</span>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, &ldquo;Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_26_74" data-osis="Matt.26.74"><span class="verse-num v-74">74&nbsp;</span>Then he began to curse and to swear, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the man!&rdquo;<br>Immediately the rooster crowed.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_26_75" data-osis="Matt.26.75"><span class="verse-num v-75">75&nbsp;</span>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</span> He went out and wept bitterly.</span>
