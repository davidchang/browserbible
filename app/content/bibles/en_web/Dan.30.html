<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>A sword shall come on Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is allied with them, shall fall with them by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: They also who uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>In that day shall messengers go out from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries in the daytime.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>It happened in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and behold, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groaning of a mortally wounded man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out on the land of Egypt.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Dan.30.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
