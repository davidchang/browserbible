<span class="verse 1Sam_27_1" data-osis="1Sam.27.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>David said in his heart, &ldquo;I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_2" data-osis="1Sam.27.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_3" data-osis="1Sam.27.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal&rsquo;s wife.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_4" data-osis="1Sam.27.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_5" data-osis="1Sam.27.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>David said to Achish, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_6" data-osis="1Sam.27.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_7" data-osis="1Sam.27.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</span>

<span class="verse 1Sam_27_9" data-osis="1Sam.27.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came to Achish.</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_10" data-osis="1Sam.27.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Achish said, &ldquo;Against whom have you made a raid today?&rdquo;<br>David said, “Against the South of Judah, against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.”</span>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_11" data-osis="1Sam.27.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, &ldquo;Lest they should tell of us, saying, &lsquo;David this, and this has been his way all the time he has lived in the country of the Philistines.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Sam_27_12" data-osis="1Sam.27.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Achish believed David, saying, &ldquo;He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him. Therefore he shall be my servant forever.&rdquo;</span>
