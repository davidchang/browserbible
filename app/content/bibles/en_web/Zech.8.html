<p>
<span class="verse Zech_8_3" data-osis="Zech.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: &ldquo;I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Zech_8_4" data-osis="Zech.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: &ldquo;Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_5" data-osis="Zech.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Zech_8_7" data-osis="Zech.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: &ldquo;Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_8" data-osis="Zech.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>and I will bring them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Zech_8_9" data-osis="Zech.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: &ldquo;Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_10" data-osis="Zech.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbor.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_11" data-osis="Zech.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_12" data-osis="Zech.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_13" data-osis="Zech.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Zech_8_14" data-osis="Zech.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh of Armies: &ldquo;As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t repent;</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_15" data-osis="Zech.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_16" data-osis="Zech.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates,</span>
<span class="verse Zech_8_17" data-osis="Zech.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,&rdquo; says Yahweh.</span>
