<span class="verse Exod_5_1" data-osis="Exod.5.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, &lsquo;Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_2" data-osis="Exod.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don&rsquo;t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_3" data-osis="Exod.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_4" data-osis="Exod.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The king of Egypt said to them, &ldquo;Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_5" data-osis="Exod.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_6" data-osis="Exod.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_7" data-osis="Exod.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_8" data-osis="Exod.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, &lsquo;Let us go and sacrifice to our God.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_9" data-osis="Exod.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don&rsquo;t let them pay any attention to lying words.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_10" data-osis="Exod.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;This is what Pharaoh says: &lsquo;I will not give you straw.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_11" data-osis="Exod.5.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_12" data-osis="Exod.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_13" data-osis="Exod.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>The taskmasters were urgent saying, &ldquo;Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_14" data-osis="Exod.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_15" data-osis="Exod.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;Why do you deal this way with your servants?</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_16" data-osis="Exod.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, &lsquo;Make brick!&rsquo; and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_17" data-osis="Exod.5.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>But he said, &ldquo;You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, &lsquo;Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_18" data-osis="Exod.5.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_19" data-osis="Exod.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, &ldquo;You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_20" data-osis="Exod.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came out from Pharaoh:</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_21" data-osis="Exod.5.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and they said to them, &ldquo;May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Exod_5_22" data-osis="Exod.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, &ldquo;Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</span>
<span class="verse Exod_5_23" data-osis="Exod.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all.&rdquo;</span>
