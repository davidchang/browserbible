<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_1" data-osis="2Chr.7.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and Yahweh&rsquo;s glory filled the house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_2" data-osis="2Chr.7.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh, because Yahweh&rsquo;s glory filled Yahweh&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_3" data-osis="2Chr.7.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and Yahweh&rsquo;s glory was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying,<br /> &ldquo;For he is good;<br /> for his loving kindness endures for ever.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_4" data-osis="2Chr.7.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_5" data-osis="2Chr.7.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_6" data-osis="2Chr.7.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised by their ministry, saying &ldquo;For his loving kindness endures for ever.&rdquo; The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_7" data-osis="2Chr.7.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_8" data-osis="2Chr.7.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_9" data-osis="2Chr.7.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_10" data-osis="2Chr.7.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_11" data-osis="2Chr.7.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Thus Solomon finished the house of Yahweh, and the king&rsquo;s house: and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon&rsquo;s heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own house.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_12" data-osis="2Chr.7.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, &ldquo;I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself for a house of sacrifice.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_13" data-osis="2Chr.7.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_14" data-osis="2Chr.7.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_15" data-osis="2Chr.7.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_16" data-osis="2Chr.7.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_17" data-osis="2Chr.7.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_18" data-osis="2Chr.7.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, &lsquo;There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_19" data-osis="2Chr.7.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_20" data-osis="2Chr.7.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_21" data-osis="2Chr.7.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, &lsquo;Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_7_22" data-osis="2Chr.7.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>They shall answer, &lsquo;Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshiped them, and served them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
