<span class="verse Deut_3_1" data-osis="Deut.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_2" data-osis="Deut.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his people, and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Deut_3_3" data-osis="Deut.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no one was left to him remaining.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_4" data-osis="Deut.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>We took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn&rsquo;t take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_5" data-osis="Deut.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides a great many towns without walls.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_6" data-osis="Deut.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_7" data-osis="Deut.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>But all the livestock, and the plunder of the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_8" data-osis="Deut.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_9" data-osis="Deut.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_10" data-osis="Deut.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>We took all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_11" data-osis="Deut.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn&rsquo;t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_12" data-osis="Deut.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_13" data-osis="Deut.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_14" data-osis="Deut.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_15" data-osis="Deut.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>I gave Gilead to Machir.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_16" data-osis="Deut.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_17" data-osis="Deut.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>the Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Deut_3_18" data-osis="Deut.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>I commanded you at that time, saying, &ldquo;Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_19" data-osis="Deut.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_20" data-osis="Deut.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own possession, which I have given you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Deut_3_21" data-osis="Deut.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, &ldquo;Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_22" data-osis="Deut.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Deut_3_23" data-osis="Deut.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_24" data-osis="Deut.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Lord<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</span></span>  Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do works like yours, and mighty acts like yours?</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_25" data-osis="Deut.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Deut_3_26" data-osis="Deut.3.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn&rsquo;t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, &ldquo;Let this satisfy you. Speak no more to me of this matter.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_27" data-osis="Deut.3.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_28" data-osis="Deut.3.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_3_29" data-osis="Deut.3.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.</span>
