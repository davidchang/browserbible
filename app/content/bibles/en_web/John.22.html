<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;Where do you want us to prepare?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Tell the master of the house, &lsquo;The Teacher says to you, &ldquo;Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&rdquo;&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called &lsquo;benefactors.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn&rsquo;t it he who sits at the table? But I am in your midst as one who serves. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn&rsquo;t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.&rdquo;</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here may be also correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>He said to him, &ldquo;Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: &lsquo;He was counted with transgressors.&rsquo;</span>\x + Isaiah 53:12\x* <span class="woc"> For that which concerns me has an end.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Lord, behold, here are two swords.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Pray that you don&rsquo;t enter into temptation.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, &ldquo;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let me at least do this&rdquo;</span>&mdash;and he touched his ear, and healed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn&rsquo;t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter followed from a distance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, &ldquo;This man also was with him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>He denied Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Woman, I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, &ldquo;You also are one of them!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, &ldquo;Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about!&rdquo; Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord&rsquo;s word, how he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>He went out, and wept bitterly.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, &ldquo;Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If you are the Christ, tell us.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>They all said, &ldquo;Are you then the Son of God?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.22.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!&rdquo;</span>
