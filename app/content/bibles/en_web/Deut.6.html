<span class="verse Deut_6_2" data-osis="Deut.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you; you, and your son, and your son&rsquo;s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_3" data-osis="Deut.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_4" data-osis="Deut.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is one.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_6_7" data-osis="Deut.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_8" data-osis="Deut.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_9" data-osis="Deut.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_10" data-osis="Deut.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn&rsquo;t build,</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_11" data-osis="Deut.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and houses full of all good things, which you didn&rsquo;t fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn&rsquo;t dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn&rsquo;t plant, and you shall eat and be full;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_12" data-osis="Deut.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_6_15" data-osis="Deut.6.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh your God in your midst is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_16" data-osis="Deut.6.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.</span>

<span class="verse Deut_6_21" data-osis="Deut.6.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>then you shall tell your son, &ldquo;We were Pharaoh&rsquo;s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_22" data-osis="Deut.6.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_23" data-osis="Deut.6.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.</span>
<span class="verse Deut_6_24" data-osis="Deut.6.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.</span>
