<span class="verse 2Chr_17_9" data-osis="2Chr.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.</span>

<span class="verse 2Chr_17_11" data-osis="2Chr.17.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_17_12" data-osis="2Chr.17.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_17_13" data-osis="2Chr.17.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_17_14" data-osis="2Chr.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>This was the numbering of them according to their fathers&rsquo; houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_17_15" data-osis="2Chr.17.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;</span>

<span class="verse 2Chr_17_18" data-osis="2Chr.17.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and next to him Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.</span>
