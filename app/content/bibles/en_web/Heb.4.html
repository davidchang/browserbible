<span class="verse Heb_4_1" data-osis="Heb.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_2" data-osis="Heb.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn&rsquo;t profit them, because it wasn&rsquo;t mixed with faith by those who heard.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_3" data-osis="Heb.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, &ldquo;As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest&rdquo;;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 95:11</span></span>  although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_4" data-osis="Heb.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, &ldquo;God rested on the seventh day from all his works&rdquo;;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Genesis 2:2</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_5" data-osis="Heb.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>and in this place again, &ldquo;They will not enter into my rest.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 95:11</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_4_6" data-osis="Heb.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein, and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_7" data-osis="Heb.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),<br /> &ldquo;Today if you will hear his voice,<br /> don&rsquo;t harden your hearts.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 95:7-8</span></span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_4_8" data-osis="Heb.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_9" data-osis="Heb.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_10" data-osis="Heb.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_11" data-osis="Heb.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_12" data-osis="Heb.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Heb_4_13" data-osis="Heb.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_14" data-osis="Heb.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Having then a great high priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our confession.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_15" data-osis="Heb.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For we don&rsquo;t have a high priest who can&rsquo;t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_16" data-osis="Heb.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help in time of need.</span>
