<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Pharisees came to him, testing him, and saying, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</span>\x + Genesis 1:27\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and said, &lsquo;For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?&rsquo;</span>\x + Genesis 2:24\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don&rsquo;t let man tear apart.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce her?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits adultery.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>His disciples said to him, &ldquo;If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&rsquo;s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven&rsquo;s sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then little children were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Allow the little children, and don&rsquo;t forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He laid his hands on them, and departed from there.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Behold, one came to him and said, &ldquo;Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you call me good?</span><span class="note"> <dfn>+ So MT and TR. NU reads &ldquo;Why do you ask me about what is good?&rdquo;</dfn></span><span class="woc"> No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>He said to him, &ldquo;Which ones?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Honor your father and mother.&rsquo;</span>\x + Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20\x*<span class="woc"> And, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>\x + Leviticus 19:18\x*</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>The young man said to him, &ldquo;All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had great possessions.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I say to you, a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.19.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&rsquo;s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life. </span></span>
