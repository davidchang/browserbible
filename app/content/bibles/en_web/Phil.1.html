<span class="verse Phil_1_2" data-osis="Phil.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_3" data-osis="Phil.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I thank my God whenever I remember you,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_4" data-osis="Phil.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_5" data-osis="Phil.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>for your partnership<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word translated &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; (koinonia) also means &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; and &ldquo;sharing.&rdquo;</span></span>  in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_6" data-osis="Phil.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_7" data-osis="Phil.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_8" data-osis="Phil.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_9" data-osis="Phil.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_10" data-osis="Phil.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_11" data-osis="Phil.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_12" data-osis="Phil.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Now I desire to have you know, brothers,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The word for &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; here and where context allows may also be correctly translated &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; or &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo;</span></span>  that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_13" data-osis="Phil.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>so that it became evident to the whole palace<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">or, praetorian</span></span>  guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_14" data-osis="Phil.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_15" data-osis="Phil.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_16" data-osis="Phil.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_17" data-osis="Phil.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_18" data-osis="Phil.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_19" data-osis="Phil.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_20" data-osis="Phil.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_21" data-osis="Phil.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_22" data-osis="Phil.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don&rsquo;t know what I will choose.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_23" data-osis="Phil.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_24" data-osis="Phil.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_25" data-osis="Phil.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_26" data-osis="Phil.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Phil_1_27" data-osis="Phil.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_28" data-osis="Phil.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_29" data-osis="Phil.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</span>
<span class="verse Phil_1_30" data-osis="Phil.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.</span>
