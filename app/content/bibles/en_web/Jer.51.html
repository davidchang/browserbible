<span class="verse Jer_51_1" data-osis="Jer.51.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_2" data-osis="Jer.51.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow her; and they shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_3" data-osis="Jer.51.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Against him who bends let the archer bend his bow, and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail: and don&rsquo;t spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_4" data-osis="Jer.51.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_5" data-osis="Jer.51.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh of Armies; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_6" data-osis="Jer.51.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; don&rsquo;t be cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Yahweh&rsquo;s vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_7" data-osis="Jer.51.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh&rsquo;s hand, who made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_8" data-osis="Jer.51.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_9" data-osis="Jer.51.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country; for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_10" data-osis="Jer.51.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has produced our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_11" data-osis="Jer.51.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_12" data-osis="Jer.51.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_13" data-osis="Jer.51.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_14" data-osis="Jer.51.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they shall lift up a shout against you.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_15" data-osis="Jer.51.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens:</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_16" data-osis="Jer.51.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightning for the rain, and brings the wind out of his treasuries.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_17" data-osis="Jer.51.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Every man has become brutish without knowledge. Every goldsmith is disappointed by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_18" data-osis="Jer.51.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_19" data-osis="Jer.51.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and is the tribe of his inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is his name.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_20" data-osis="Jer.51.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>You are my battle ax and weapons of war: and with you will I break in pieces the nations; and with you will I destroy kingdoms;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_21" data-osis="Jer.51.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_22" data-osis="Jer.51.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and him who rides therein; and with you will I break in pieces man and woman; and with you will I break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin;</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_23" data-osis="Jer.51.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his yoke; and with you will I break in pieces governors and deputies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_24" data-osis="Jer.51.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_25" data-osis="Jer.51.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain, says Yahweh, which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_26" data-osis="Jer.51.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>They shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_27" data-osis="Jer.51.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_28" data-osis="Jer.51.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its deputies, and all the land of their dominion.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_29" data-osis="Jer.51.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_30" data-osis="Jer.51.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed; they are become as women: her dwelling places are set on fire; her bars are broken.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_31" data-osis="Jer.51.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_32" data-osis="Jer.51.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_33" data-osis="Jer.51.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_34" data-osis="Jer.51.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has, like a monster, swallowed me up, he has filled his maw with my delicacies; he has cast me out.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_35" data-osis="Jer.51.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_36" data-osis="Jer.51.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_37" data-osis="Jer.51.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_38" data-osis="Jer.51.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions&rsquo; cubs.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_39" data-osis="Jer.51.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_40" data-osis="Jer.51.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with male goats.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_41" data-osis="Jer.51.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_42" data-osis="Jer.51.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>The sea has come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_43" data-osis="Jer.51.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass thereby.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_44" data-osis="Jer.51.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more to him: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_45" data-osis="Jer.51.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>My people, go away from the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_46" data-osis="Jer.51.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land; for news shall come one year, and after that in another year shall come news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_47" data-osis="Jer.51.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_48" data-osis="Jer.51.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_49" data-osis="Jer.51.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_50" data-osis="Jer.51.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>You who have escaped the sword, go, don&rsquo;t stand still; remember Yahweh from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_51" data-osis="Jer.51.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has covered our faces: for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh&rsquo;s house.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_52" data-osis="Jer.51.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>Therefore behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will execute judgment on her engraved images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_53" data-osis="Jer.51.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come to her, says Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_54" data-osis="Jer.51.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_55" data-osis="Jer.51.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_56" data-osis="Jer.51.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>for the destroyer has come on her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_57" data-osis="Jer.51.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_58" data-osis="Jer.51.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_59" data-osis="Jer.51.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_60" data-osis="Jer.51.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_61" data-osis="Jer.51.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_62" data-osis="Jer.51.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that no one shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_63" data-osis="Jer.51.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:</span>
<span class="verse Jer_51_64" data-osis="Jer.51.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>and you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</span>
