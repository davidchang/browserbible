<span class="verse John_11_1" data-osis="John.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_2" data-osis="John.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother, Lazarus, was sick.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_3" data-osis="John.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is sick.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_4" data-osis="John.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>But when Jesus heard it, he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God&rsquo;s Son may be glorified by it.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_5" data-osis="John.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_6" data-osis="John.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When therefore he heard that he was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_7" data-osis="John.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then after this he said to the disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into Judea again.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_8" data-osis="John.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The disciples told him, &ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_9" data-osis="John.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn&rsquo;t stumble, because he sees the light of this world. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_10" data-osis="John.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But if a man walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light isn&rsquo;t in him.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_11" data-osis="John.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>He said these things, and after that, he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_12" data-osis="John.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The disciples therefore said, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_13" data-osis="John.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_14" data-osis="John.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to them plainly then, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Lazarus is dead. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_15" data-osis="John.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s go to him.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_16" data-osis="John.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus,<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">&ldquo;Didymus&rdquo; means &ldquo;Twin&rdquo;</span></span>  said to his fellow disciples, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go also, that we may die with him.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_17" data-osis="John.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_18" data-osis="John.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">15 stadia is about 2.8 kilometers or 1.7 miles</span></span>  away.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_19" data-osis="John.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_20" data-osis="John.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_21" data-osis="John.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore Martha said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn&rsquo;t have died.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_22" data-osis="John.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_23" data-osis="John.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Your brother will rise again.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_24" data-osis="John.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Martha said to him, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_25" data-osis="John.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_26" data-osis="John.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_27" data-osis="John.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>She said to him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God&rsquo;s Son, he who comes into the world.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_28" data-osis="John.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, &ldquo;The Teacher is here, and is calling you.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_29" data-osis="John.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_30" data-osis="John.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_31" data-osis="John.11.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, &ldquo;She is going to the tomb to weep there.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_32" data-osis="John.11.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, &ldquo;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn&rsquo;t have died.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_33" data-osis="John.11.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</span>
<span class="verse John_11_34" data-osis="John.11.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where have you laid him?&rdquo;</span><br>They told him, “Lord, come and see.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_35" data-osis="John.11.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus wept.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_36" data-osis="John.11.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said, &ldquo;See how much affection he had for him!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_37" data-osis="John.11.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Some of them said, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this man from dying?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_38" data-osis="John.11.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore, again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_39" data-osis="John.11.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take away the stone.&rdquo;</span><br>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_40" data-osis="John.11.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that if you believed, you would see God&rsquo;s glory?&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_41" data-osis="John.11.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying.<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">NU omits &ldquo;from the place where the dead man was lying.&rdquo;</span></span>  Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, I thank you that you listened to me. </span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_42" data-osis="John.11.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_43" data-osis="John.11.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_44" data-osis="John.11.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.<br>Jesus said to them, \wj “Free him, and let him go.”\wj*</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_45" data-osis="John.11.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_46" data-osis="John.11.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_47" data-osis="John.11.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, &ldquo;What are we doing? For this man does many signs.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_48" data-osis="John.11.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_49" data-osis="John.11.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, &ldquo;You know nothing at all,</span>
<span class="verse John_11_50" data-osis="John.11.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_51" data-osis="John.11.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>Now he didn&rsquo;t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</span>
<span class="verse John_11_52" data-osis="John.11.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_53" data-osis="John.11.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put him to death.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_54" data-osis="John.11.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse John_11_55" data-osis="John.11.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_56" data-osis="John.11.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;that he isn&rsquo;t coming to the feast at all?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_57" data-osis="John.11.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that they might seize him.</span>
