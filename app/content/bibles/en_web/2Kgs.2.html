<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_16" data-osis="2Kgs.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>They said to him, &ldquo;See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men.

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_17" data-osis="2Kgs.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, &ldquo;Send them.&rdquo;<br>They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_18" data-osis="2Kgs.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_20" data-osis="2Kgs.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.&rdquo; They brought it to him.</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_21" data-osis="2Kgs.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, &ldquo;Thus says Yahweh, &lsquo;I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_22" data-osis="2Kgs.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</span>

<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_23" data-osis="2Kgs.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Kgs_2_24" data-osis="2Kgs.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh&rsquo;s name. Two female bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.</span>
