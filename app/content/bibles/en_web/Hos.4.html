<span class="verse Hos_4_1" data-osis="Hos.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel;<br /> for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:<br /> &ldquo;Indeed there is no truth,<br /> nor goodness,<br /> nor knowledge of God in the land.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_2" data-osis="Hos.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;<br /> they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_3" data-osis="Hos.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore the land will mourn,<br /> and everyone who dwells therein will waste away.<br /> all living things in her,<br /> even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;<br /> yes, the fish of the sea also die.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_4_4" data-osis="Hos.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_5" data-osis="Hos.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>You will stumble in the day,<br /> and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;<br /> and I will destroy your mother.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_6" data-osis="Hos.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.<br /> Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,<br /> that you may be no priest to me.<br /> Because you have forgotten your God&rsquo;s law,<br /> I will also forget your children.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_7" data-osis="Hos.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.<br /> I will change their glory into shame.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_8" data-osis="Hos.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They feed on the sin of my people,<br /> and set their heart on their iniquity.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_9" data-osis="Hos.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>It will be, like people, like priest;<br /> and I will punish them for their ways,<br /> and will repay them for their deeds.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_10" data-osis="Hos.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They will eat, and not have enough.<br /> They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;<br /> because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_11" data-osis="Hos.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_12" data-osis="Hos.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>My people consult with their wooden idol,<br /> and answer to a stick of wood.<br /> Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,<br /> and they have been unfaithful to their God.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_13" data-osis="Hos.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,<br /> and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,<br /> because its shade is good.<br /> Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,<br /> and your brides commit adultery.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_14" data-osis="Hos.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,<br /> nor your brides when they commit adultery;<br /> because the men consort with prostitutes,<br /> and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;<br /> so the people without understanding will come to ruin.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Hos_4_15" data-osis="Hos.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,<br /> yet don&rsquo;t let Judah offend;<br /> and don&rsquo;t come to Gilgal,<br /> neither go up to Beth Aven,<br /> nor swear, &lsquo;As Yahweh lives.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_16" data-osis="Hos.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.<br /> Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_17" data-osis="Hos.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is joined to idols.<br /> Leave him alone!<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_18" data-osis="Hos.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Their drink has become sour.<br /> They play the prostitute continually.<br /> Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Hos_4_19" data-osis="Hos.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;<br /> and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.</span>
