<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_1" data-osis="Acts.19.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_2" data-osis="Acts.19.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He said to them, &ldquo;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&rdquo;<br>They said to him, “No, we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_3" data-osis="Acts.19.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Into what then were you baptized?&rdquo;<br>They said, “Into John’s baptism.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_4" data-osis="Acts.19.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Paul said, &ldquo;John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_5" data-osis="Acts.19.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_6" data-osis="Acts.19.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_7" data-osis="Acts.19.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They were about twelve men in all.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_8" data-osis="Acts.19.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_9" data-osis="Acts.19.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_10" data-osis="Acts.19.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_11" data-osis="Acts.19.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_12" data-osis="Acts.19.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_13" data-osis="Acts.19.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_14" data-osis="Acts.19.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_15" data-osis="Acts.19.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The evil spirit answered, &ldquo;Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_16" data-osis="Acts.19.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_17" data-osis="Acts.19.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_18" data-osis="Acts.19.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_19" data-osis="Acts.19.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted their price, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The 50,000 pieces of silver here probably referred to 50,000 drachmas. If so, the value of the burned books was equivalent to about 160 man-years of wages for agricultural laborers</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_20" data-osis="Acts.19.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>So the word of the Lord was growing and becoming mighty.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_21" data-osis="Acts.19.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, &ldquo;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_22" data-osis="Acts.19.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_23" data-osis="Acts.19.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_24" data-osis="Acts.19.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_25" data-osis="Acts.19.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, &ldquo;Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_26" data-osis="Acts.19.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_27" data-osis="Acts.19.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_28" data-osis="Acts.19.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, &ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_29" data-osis="Acts.19.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul&rsquo;s companions in travel.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_30" data-osis="Acts.19.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn&rsquo;t allow him.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_31" data-osis="Acts.19.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_32" data-osis="Acts.19.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn&rsquo;t know why they had come together.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_33" data-osis="Acts.19.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would have made a defense to the people.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_34" data-osis="Acts.19.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, &ldquo;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Acts_19_35" data-osis="Acts.19.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, &ldquo;You men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn&rsquo;t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_36" data-osis="Acts.19.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Seeing then that these things can&rsquo;t be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_37" data-osis="Acts.19.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_38" data-osis="Acts.19.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_39" data-osis="Acts.19.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_40" data-osis="Acts.19.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day&rsquo;s riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give an account of this commotion.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Acts_19_41" data-osis="Acts.19.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</span>
