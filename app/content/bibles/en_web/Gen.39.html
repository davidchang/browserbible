<span class="verse Gen_39_5" data-osis="Gen.39.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_6" data-osis="Gen.39.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand. He didn&rsquo;t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.<br>Joseph was well-built and handsome.</span>
<span class="verse Gen_39_7" data-osis="Gen.39.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It happened after these things, that his master&rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</span>
