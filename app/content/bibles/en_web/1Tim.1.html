<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_1" data-osis="1Tim.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_2" data-osis="1Tim.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_3" data-osis="1Tim.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_4" data-osis="1Tim.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God&rsquo;s stewardship, which is in faith&mdash;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_5" data-osis="1Tim.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_6" data-osis="1Tim.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_7" data-osis="1Tim.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_8" data-osis="1Tim.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_9" data-osis="1Tim.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for man slayers,</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_10" data-osis="1Tim.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_11" data-osis="1Tim.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_12" data-osis="1Tim.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_13" data-osis="1Tim.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_14" data-osis="1Tim.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_15" data-osis="1Tim.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_16" data-osis="1Tim.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_17" data-osis="1Tim.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_18" data-osis="1Tim.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_19" data-osis="1Tim.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;</span>
<span class="verse 1Tim_1_20" data-osis="1Tim.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</span>
