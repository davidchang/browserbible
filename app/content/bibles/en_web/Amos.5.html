<span class="verse Amos_5_4" data-osis="Amos.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel:<br /> &ldquo;Seek me, and you will live;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Amos_5_5" data-osis="Amos.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>but don&rsquo;t seek Bethel,<br /> nor enter into Gilgal,<br /> and don&rsquo;t pass to Beersheba:<br /> for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,<br /> and Bethel shall come to nothing.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Amos_5_6" data-osis="Amos.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Seek Yahweh, and you will live;<br /> lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,<br /> and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Amos_5_12" data-osis="Amos.5.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For I know how many your offenses,<br /> and how great are your sins&mdash;<br /> you who afflict the just,<br /> who take a bribe,<br /> and who turn aside the needy in the courts.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Amos_5_13" data-osis="Amos.5.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,<br /> for it is an evil time.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Amos_5_19" data-osis="Amos.5.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>As if a man fled from a lion,<br /> and a bear met him;<br /> Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,<br /> and a snake bit him.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Amos_5_20" data-osis="Amos.5.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?<br /> Even very dark, and no brightness in it?<br /></span>
