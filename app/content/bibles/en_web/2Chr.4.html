<span class="verse 2Chr_4_3" data-osis="2Chr.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</span>

<span class="verse 2Chr_4_5" data-osis="2Chr.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>It was a hand breadth thick; and its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_6" data-osis="2Chr.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_7" data-osis="2Chr.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</span>

<span class="verse 2Chr_4_11" data-osis="2Chr.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God&rsquo;s house:</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_12" data-osis="2Chr.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_13" data-osis="2Chr.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_14" data-osis="2Chr.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He made also the bases, and the basins made he on the bases;</span>

<span class="verse 2Chr_4_17" data-osis="2Chr.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_18" data-osis="2Chr.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_19" data-osis="2Chr.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Solomon made all the vessels that were in God&rsquo;s house, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_20" data-osis="2Chr.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and the lamp stands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</span>
<span class="verse 2Chr_4_21" data-osis="2Chr.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;</span>
