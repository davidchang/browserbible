<span class="verse Jas_4_1" data-osis="Jas.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don&rsquo;t they come from your pleasures that war in your members?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_2" data-osis="Jas.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You lust, and don&rsquo;t have. You kill, covet, and can&rsquo;t obtain. You fight and make war. You don&rsquo;t have, because you don&rsquo;t ask.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_3" data-osis="Jas.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>You ask, and don&rsquo;t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it for your pleasures.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_4" data-osis="Jas.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>You adulterers and adulteresses, don&rsquo;t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_5" data-osis="Jas.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, &ldquo;The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously&rdquo;?</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_6" data-osis="Jas.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, &ldquo;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Proverbs 3:34</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_7" data-osis="Jas.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_8" data-osis="Jas.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_9" data-osis="Jas.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_10" data-osis="Jas.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_4_11" data-osis="Jas.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_12" data-osis="Jas.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Jas_4_13" data-osis="Jas.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Come now, you who say, &ldquo;Today or tomorrow let&rsquo;s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_14" data-osis="Jas.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Whereas you don&rsquo;t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_15" data-osis="Jas.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>For you ought to say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_16" data-osis="Jas.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil.</span>
<span class="verse Jas_4_17" data-osis="Jas.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn&rsquo;t do it, to him it is sin.</span>
