<span class="verse Col_3_2" data-osis="Col.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_3" data-osis="Col.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_4" data-osis="Col.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_5" data-osis="Col.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_6" data-osis="Col.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>for which things&rsquo; sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_7" data-osis="Col.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_8" data-osis="Col.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_9" data-osis="Col.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Don&rsquo;t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_10" data-osis="Col.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_11" data-osis="Col.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>where there can&rsquo;t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_12" data-osis="Col.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Put on therefore, as God&rsquo;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_13" data-osis="Col.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_14" data-osis="Col.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_15" data-osis="Col.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_16" data-osis="Col.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_17" data-osis="Col.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_18" data-osis="Col.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_20" data-osis="Col.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_21" data-osis="Col.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Fathers, don&rsquo;t provoke your children, so that they won&rsquo;t be discouraged.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Col_3_22" data-osis="Col.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_23" data-osis="Col.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_24" data-osis="Col.3.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</span>
<span class="verse Col_3_25" data-osis="Col.3.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</span>
