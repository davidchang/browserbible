<span class="verse 1Kgs_17_8" data-osis="1Kgs.17.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to him, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_17_9" data-osis="1Kgs.17.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_17_14" data-osis="1Kgs.17.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &lsquo;The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
