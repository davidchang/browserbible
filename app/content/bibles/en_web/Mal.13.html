<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, &lsquo;You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh&rsquo;s name;&rsquo; and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>but he will say, &lsquo;I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>One will say to him, &lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo; Then he will answer, &lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mal.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>It shall happen that in all the land,&rdquo; says Yahweh,</span>
