<span class="verse Dan_8_1" data-osis="Dan.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_2" data-osis="Dan.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_3" data-osis="Dan.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_4" data-osis="Dan.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_5" data-osis="Dan.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn&rsquo;t touch the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_6" data-osis="Dan.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_7" data-osis="Dan.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_8" data-osis="Dan.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The male goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable<ins>horns</ins> toward the four winds of the sky.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_9" data-osis="Dan.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious <ins>land</ins>.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_10" data-osis="Dan.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_11" data-osis="Dan.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the army; and it took away from him the continual <ins>burnt offering</ins>, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_12" data-osis="Dan.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>The army was given over <ins>to it</ins> together with the continual<ins>burnt offering</ins> through disobedience; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did <ins>its pleasure</ins> and prospered.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_13" data-osis="Dan.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long shall be the vision <ins>concerning</ins> the continual <ins>burnt offering</ins>, and the disobedience that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the army to be trodden under foot?</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_14" data-osis="Dan.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings <ins>and</ins> mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_15" data-osis="Dan.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>It happened, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_16" data-osis="Dan.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>I heard a man&rsquo;s voice between <ins>the banks of</ins> the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_17" data-osis="Dan.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_18" data-osis="Dan.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_19" data-osis="Dan.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>He said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_20" data-osis="Dan.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_21" data-osis="Dan.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>The rough male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_22" data-osis="Dan.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>As for that which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_23" data-osis="Dan.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce face, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_24" data-osis="Dan.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do <ins>his pleasure</ins>; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_25" data-osis="Dan.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in <ins>their</ins> security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_26" data-osis="Dan.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true: but seal up the vision; for it belongs to many days <ins>to come</ins>.</span>
<span class="verse Dan_8_27" data-osis="Dan.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king&rsquo;s business: and I wondered at the vision, but no one understood it.</span>
