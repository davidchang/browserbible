<span class="verse Lev_9_1" data-osis="Lev.9.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_2" data-osis="Lev.9.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>and he said to Aaron, &ldquo;Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and offer them before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_3" data-osis="Lev.9.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, &lsquo;Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for a burnt offering;</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_4" data-osis="Lev.9.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Lev_9_5" data-osis="Lev.9.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_6" data-osis="Lev.9.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Moses said, &ldquo;This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and Yahweh&rsquo;s glory shall appear to you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_7" data-osis="Lev.9.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as Yahweh commanded.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Lev_9_8" data-osis="Lev.9.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_9" data-osis="Lev.9.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_10" data-osis="Lev.9.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_11" data-osis="Lev.9.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_12" data-osis="Lev.9.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_13" data-osis="Lev.9.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_14" data-osis="Lev.9.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_15" data-osis="Lev.9.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He presented the people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_16" data-osis="Lev.9.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_17" data-osis="Lev.9.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_18" data-osis="Lev.9.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron&rsquo;s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_19" data-osis="Lev.9.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_20" data-osis="Lev.9.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_21" data-osis="Lev.9.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_22" data-osis="Lev.9.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Lev_9_23" data-osis="Lev.9.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and Yahweh&rsquo;s glory appeared to all the people.</span>
<span class="verse Lev_9_24" data-osis="Lev.9.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Fire came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</span>
