<span class="verse Num_31_3" data-osis="Num.31.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Moses spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Yahweh&rsquo;s vengeance on Midian.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_4" data-osis="Num.31.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_5" data-osis="Num.31.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_6" data-osis="Num.31.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_7" data-osis="Num.31.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They fought against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses. They killed every male.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_8" data-osis="Num.31.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_9" data-osis="Num.31.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_10" data-osis="Num.31.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_11" data-osis="Num.31.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_12" data-osis="Num.31.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>They brought the captives, and the prey, and the plunder, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_13" data-osis="Num.31.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_14" data-osis="Num.31.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_15" data-osis="Num.31.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Moses said to them, &ldquo;Have you saved all the women alive?</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_16" data-osis="Num.31.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_17" data-osis="Num.31.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_18" data-osis="Num.31.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Num_31_21" data-osis="Num.31.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, &ldquo;This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_22" data-osis="Num.31.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_23" data-osis="Num.31.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. All that doesn&rsquo;t withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_24" data-osis="Num.31.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come into the camp.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Num_31_25" data-osis="Num.31.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>

<span class="verse Num_31_27" data-osis="Num.31.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_28" data-osis="Num.31.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_29" data-osis="Num.31.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh&rsquo;s wave offering.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_30" data-osis="Num.31.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Of the children of Israel&rsquo;s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of Yahweh&rsquo;s tabernacle.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse Num_31_32" data-osis="Num.31.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,</span>

<span class="verse Num_31_41" data-osis="Num.31.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh&rsquo;s wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_42" data-osis="Num.31.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Of the children of Israel&rsquo;s half, which Moses divided off from the men who fought</span>
<span class="verse Num_31_43" data-osis="Num.31.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>(now the congregation&rsquo;s half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,</span>
