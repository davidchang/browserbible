<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_1" data-osis="1Kgs.8.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers&rsquo; households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_2" data-osis="1Kgs.8.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_3" data-osis="1Kgs.8.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_4" data-osis="1Kgs.8.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these the priests and the Levites brought up.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_5" data-osis="1Kgs.8.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_6" data-osis="1Kgs.8.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_7" data-osis="1Kgs.8.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_8" data-osis="1Kgs.8.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_9" data-osis="1Kgs.8.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_10" data-osis="1Kgs.8.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_11" data-osis="1Kgs.8.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh&rsquo;s glory filled the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_12" data-osis="1Kgs.8.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon said, &ldquo;Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_13" data-osis="1Kgs.8.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_14" data-osis="1Kgs.8.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_15" data-osis="1Kgs.8.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_16" data-osis="1Kgs.8.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_17" data-osis="1Kgs.8.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_18" data-osis="1Kgs.8.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh said to David my father, &lsquo;Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_19" data-osis="1Kgs.8.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, you shall not build the house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_20" data-osis="1Kgs.8.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_21" data-osis="1Kgs.8.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>There I have set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_22" data-osis="1Kgs.8.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_23" data-osis="1Kgs.8.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>and he said, &ldquo;Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_24" data-osis="1Kgs.8.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_25" data-osis="1Kgs.8.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, may Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, &lsquo;There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_26" data-osis="1Kgs.8.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore, God of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David my father.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_27" data-osis="1Kgs.8.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can&rsquo;t contain you; how much less this house that I have built!</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_28" data-osis="1Kgs.8.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_29" data-osis="1Kgs.8.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, &lsquo;My name shall be there;&rsquo; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_30" data-osis="1Kgs.8.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Listen to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_31" data-osis="1Kgs.8.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swear before your altar in this house;</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_32" data-osis="1Kgs.8.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>then hear in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_33" data-osis="1Kgs.8.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house:</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_54" data-osis="1Kgs.8.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>It was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_55" data-osis="1Kgs.8.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>He stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,</span>

<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_62" data-osis="1Kgs.8.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_63" data-osis="1Kgs.8.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_64" data-osis="1Kgs.8.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_65" data-osis="1Kgs.8.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.</span>
<span class="verse 1Kgs_8_66" data-osis="1Kgs.8.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people.</span>
