<span class="verse Mic_3_2" data-osis="Mic.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You who hate the good,<br /> and love the evil;<br /> who tear off their skin,<br /> and their flesh from off their bones;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_3_3" data-osis="Mic.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>who also eat the flesh of my people,<br /> and flay their skin from off them,<br /> and break their bones,<br /> and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,<br /> and as flesh within the cauldron.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_3_4" data-osis="Mic.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Then they will cry to Yahweh,<br /> but he will not answer them.<br /> Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,<br /> because they made their deeds evil.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse Mic_3_5" data-osis="Mic.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; and whoever doesn&rsquo;t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_3_6" data-osis="Mic.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Therefore night is over you, with no vision,<br /> and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;<br /> and the sun will go down on the prophets,<br /> and the day will be black over them.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_3_7" data-osis="Mic.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>The seers shall be disappointed,<br /> and the diviners confounded.<br /> Yes, they shall all cover their lips;<br /> for there is no answer from God<span class="note"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</span></span> .&rdquo;<br /></span>

<span class="verse Mic_3_9" data-osis="Mic.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,<br /> and rulers of the house of Israel,<br /> who abhor justice,<br /> and pervert all equity.<br /></span>

<span class="verse Mic_3_11" data-osis="Mic.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Her leaders judge for bribes,<br /> and her priests teach for a price,<br /> and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:<br /> yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,<br /> &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Yahweh in the midst of us?<br /> No disaster will come on us.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Mic_3_12" data-osis="Mic.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,<br /> and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,<br /> and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.</span>
