<span class="verse Isa_6_1" data-osis="Isa.6.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_2" data-osis="Isa.6.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_3" data-osis="Isa.6.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>One called to another, and said,<br /> &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!<br /> The whole earth is full of his glory!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_6_4" data-osis="Isa.6.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_5" data-osis="Isa.6.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &ldquo;Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_6_6" data-osis="Isa.6.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_7" data-osis="Isa.6.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>He touched my mouth with it, and said, &ldquo;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_6_8" data-osis="Isa.6.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I heard the Lord&rsquo;s voice, saying, &ldquo;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&rdquo;<br>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_6_9" data-osis="Isa.6.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Go, and tell this people,<br /> &lsquo;You hear indeed,<br /> but don&rsquo;t understand;<br /> and you see indeed,<br /> but don&rsquo;t perceive.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_10" data-osis="Isa.6.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Make the heart of this people fat.<br /> Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;<br /> lest they see with their eyes,<br /> and hear with their ears,<br /> and understand with their heart,<br /> and turn again, and be healed.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Isa_6_11" data-osis="Isa.6.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Then I said, &ldquo;Lord, how long?&rdquo;<br>He answered,<br /> &ldquo;Until cities are waste without inhabitant,<br /> and houses without man,<br /> and the land becomes utterly waste,<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_12" data-osis="Isa.6.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>And Yahweh has removed men far away,<br /> and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.<br /></span>
<span class="verse Isa_6_13" data-osis="Isa.6.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>If there is a tenth left in it,<br /> that also will in turn be consumed:<br /> as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled;<br /> so the holy seed is its stock.&rdquo;</span>
