<span class="verse Rom_2_1" data-osis="Rom.2.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_2" data-osis="Rom.2.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_3" data-osis="Rom.2.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_4" data-osis="Rom.2.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_5" data-osis="Rom.2.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_6" data-osis="Rom.2.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>who &ldquo;will pay back to everyone according to their works:&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12</span></span> </span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_7" data-osis="Rom.2.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_8" data-osis="Rom.2.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>but to those who are self-seeking, and don&rsquo;t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_9" data-osis="Rom.2.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_2_10" data-osis="Rom.2.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_11" data-osis="Rom.2.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>For there is no partiality with God.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_12" data-osis="Rom.2.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_13" data-osis="Rom.2.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>For it isn&rsquo;t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_14" data-osis="Rom.2.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>(for when Gentiles who don&rsquo;t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_15" data-osis="Rom.2.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_16" data-osis="Rom.2.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Rom_2_17" data-osis="Rom.2.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_18" data-osis="Rom.2.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_19" data-osis="Rom.2.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_20" data-osis="Rom.2.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_21" data-osis="Rom.2.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>You therefore who teach another, don&rsquo;t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn&rsquo;t steal, do you steal?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_22" data-osis="Rom.2.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>You who say a man shouldn&rsquo;t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_23" data-osis="Rom.2.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_24" data-osis="Rom.2.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>For &ldquo;the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&rdquo;<span class="cf"><span class="key">+</span><span class="text">Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22</span></span>  just as it is written.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_25" data-osis="Rom.2.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_26" data-osis="Rom.2.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won&rsquo;t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_27" data-osis="Rom.2.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_28" data-osis="Rom.2.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</span>
<span class="verse Rom_2_29" data-osis="Rom.2.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</span>
