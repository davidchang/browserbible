<span class="verse Ezek_11_2" data-osis="Ezek.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_3" data-osis="Ezek.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>who say, The time is not near to build houses: this is the cauldron, and we are the meat.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_4" data-osis="Ezek.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_5" data-osis="Ezek.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, Speak, Thus says Yahweh: Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_6" data-osis="Ezek.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_7" data-osis="Ezek.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the meat, and this is the cauldron; but you shall be brought out of its midst.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_8" data-osis="Ezek.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_9" data-osis="Ezek.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_10" data-osis="Ezek.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_11" data-osis="Ezek.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>This shall not be your cauldron, neither shall you be the meat in its midst; I will judge you in the border of Israel;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_12" data-osis="Ezek.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>and you shall know that I am Yahweh: for you have not walked in my statutes, neither have you executed my ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_13" data-osis="Ezek.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>It happened, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.

<span class="verse Ezek_11_14" data-osis="Ezek.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_15" data-osis="Ezek.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Go far away from Yahweh.

<span class="verse Ezek_11_16" data-osis="Ezek.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_17" data-osis="Ezek.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_18" data-osis="Ezek.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They shall come there, and they shall take away all the detestable things of it and all its abominations from there.</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_19" data-osis="Ezek.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;</span>
<span class="verse Ezek_11_20" data-osis="Ezek.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span>
