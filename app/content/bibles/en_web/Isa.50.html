<span class="verse Isa_50_1" data-osis="Isa.50.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;Where is the bill of your mother&rsquo;s divorce, with which I have put her away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_2" data-osis="Isa.50.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Why, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can&rsquo;t redeem? or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_3" data-osis="Isa.50.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.&rdquo;</span>
<br /><br />
<span class="verse Isa_50_4" data-osis="Isa.50.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_5" data-osis="Isa.50.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_6" data-osis="Isa.50.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I didn&rsquo;t hide my face from shame and spitting.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_7" data-osis="Isa.50.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For the Lord Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_8" data-osis="Isa.50.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>He is near who justifies me; who will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_9" data-osis="Isa.50.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me; who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_10" data-osis="Isa.50.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Who is among you who fears Yahweh, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in Yahweh&rsquo;s name, and rely on his God.</span>
<span class="verse Isa_50_11" data-osis="Isa.50.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You shall have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.</span>
